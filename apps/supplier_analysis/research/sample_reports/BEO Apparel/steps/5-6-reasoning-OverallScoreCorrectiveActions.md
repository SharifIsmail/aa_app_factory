# **LkSG Supplier Risk Assessment – Step 5 & 6: Assigning Risk & Taking Action**  
**🚀 Exhaustive Training Guide for Interns**  

---

## **🎯 Why These Steps Matter**  
At this point, we’ve gathered **all the risk data** from Step 3 and quantified it. Now, we must:  
✅ **Step 5**: Assign an **overall risk rating** based on the **Country, Industry, and Supplier-Specific risks**.  
✅ **Step 6**: Recommend **specific corrective actions** to mitigate high-risk factors.  

This ensures **consistent decision-making** and helps determine whether a supplier is:  
✔️ **Safe to work with**  
⚠️ **Needs further monitoring**  
🚨 **Too risky to engage with (requires major improvements or disengagement)**  

---

# **🔹 Step 5: Assigning an Overall Risk Rating**
**Your job in this step:**  
- Review the **risk scores** from Step 3.  
- Calculate the **final score** as an average of Country, Industry, and Supplier-Specific risks.  
- Assign a **severity level** (Low, Medium, or High).  

---

### **📌 How to Calculate the Final Score**
Each **risk category** (Country, Industry, Supplier-Specific) was scored **1-10** in Step 3.  
Now, **average these three scores** to determine the overall supplier risk.  

✅ **Formula**:  
```
Final Score = (Country Risk Score + Industry Risk Score + Supplier Risk Score) ÷ 3
```

### **📊 Risk Rating Table**
Fill in this table using your previous risk assessments:  

| **Category** | **Score (1-10)** | **Severity** |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Country Risk** | X | Low / Medium / High |
| **Industry Risk** | X | Low / Medium / High |
| **Supplier-Specific Risk** | X | Low / Medium / High |
| **Final Score (Average)** | **[X]** | **Low / Medium / High** |

---

### **📌 How to Determine Severity**
**Convert the final score to a risk category:**  

| **Final Score** | **Severity** | **What It Means** |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **1 - 3** | **Low Risk** ✅ | Supplier operates in a low-risk environment, with minimal concerns. |
| **4 - 6** | **Medium Risk** ⚠️ | Some concerns exist, but can be addressed with proper controls. |
| **7 - 10** | **High Risk** 🚨 | Significant risks exist, requiring urgent mitigation. |

✅ **Low Risk** – The supplier is safe to work with. Proceed to normal contract procedures.  
⚠️ **Medium Risk** – The supplier needs **improvements**, but engagement is possible with conditions.  
🚨 **High Risk** – The supplier **cannot** be onboarded without **corrective actions**.  

---

# **🔹 Step 6: Recommending Corrective Actions**
**Your job in this step:**  
- Identify **issues** from Step 3 (e.g., forced labor, corruption, lack of safety audits).  
- Suggest **specific corrective actions** to address them.  
- Set a **realistic deadline** for improvement.  

---

### **📌 How to Recommend Corrective Actions**
Use the table below to document specific actions for **each issue found**:  

| **Issue** | **Corrective Action** | **Deadline** |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| [Issue 1] | [Action Plan] | [3 Months] |
| [Issue 2] | [Action Plan] | [6 Months] |

---

### **📌 Common Issues & Corrective Actions**
Here are examples of common risk findings and recommended actions:  

| **Issue Found** | **Example Corrective Action** | **Recommended Deadline** |
|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **High Corruption Risk (Country-Level)** | Require supplier to provide **third-party audit reports** on financial transactions. | **3-6 Months** |
| **Industry Linked to Forced Labor** | Demand supplier **prove compliance** with OECD & SA8000 guidelines. | **3-6 Months** |
| **No Supplier Safety Audits Available** | Require a **third-party safety audit (BSCI, Sedex, OEKO-TEX)** before contract renewal. | **3 Months** |
| **Supplier has history of worker complaints** | Implement **grievance mechanisms** for employees & conduct surprise inspections. | **6 Months** |
| **No environmental policies in place** | Require supplier to implement **sustainable production guidelines**. | **6 Months** |

# **🚀 How to Complete Your Job**
✅ **Step 1:** Review the **Country, Industry, and Supplier-Specific** risk scores.  
✅ **Step 2:** Calculate the **Final Score** (Average of the three scores).  
✅ **Step 3:** Assign a **Low, Medium, or High** risk rating based on the final score.  
✅ **Step 4:** Identify any **issues requiring corrective action**.  
✅ **Step 5:** Document an **Action Plan** for each issue with **clear deadlines**.  
✅ **Step 6:** Flag **high-risk suppliers** for **follow-up assessments** after deadlines.  

---

### **📌 Final Decision: What to Do with the Supplier?**
Once the **overall risk rating is assigned**, make a **recommendation**:  

| **Final Score (Risk Level)** | **Next Steps** |
|----------------------------|---------------|
| ✅ **Low Risk (1-3)** | Approve supplier with standard compliance monitoring. |
| ⚠️ **Medium Risk (4-6)** | Approve supplier **only with corrective actions** in place. Follow up at set deadlines. |
| 🚨 **High Risk (7-10)** | **Supplier is too risky**. Engagement should be delayed or declined **until major risks are mitigated**. |
