# **LkSG Supplier Risk Assessment - Step 2: Gather Initial Supplier Data**
### **Exhaustive Training Guide for Interns**

---

## **1. Why This Step Matters**
Before analyzing risks (human rights violations, corruption, safety issues, etc.), we must **clearly identify the supplier**.  
At this stage, we are **not investigating risks or compliance issues**—we are only ensuring we are assessing the **correct** entity.

A **good analyst** follows these principles:  
✅ **Accuracy**: Verify company identity to avoid confusion with similarly named entities.  
✅ **Comprehensiveness**: Collect all relevant business details.  
✅ **Reliability**: Use official and trusted data sources.  
✅ **Cross-verification**: Confirm findings from **multiple sources**.  

### **🚨 What Are We NOT Doing in This Step?**  
🚫 **We are NOT assessing risks** (human rights violations, corruption, safety issues, etc.) – That happens in **Step 3**.  
🚫 **We are NOT verifying certifications** – That also happens in **Step 3**.  
🚫 **We are NOT researching lawsuits, controversies, or regulatory fines** – Again, **Step 3**.

## **2. What Information Do We Need?**
Before starting research, we need a **clear checklist** of data to collect:

| **Category** | **Required Data** | **Why It’s Important** |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Company Identity** | Full legal name, alternative names, subsidiaries | Ensures we assess the right entity. |
| **Location** | Headquarters, factory locations, registered offices | Identifies **where** the supplier operates. |
| **Industry** | Official industry classification (e.g., textile, electronics) | Determines **what sector** the company operates in. |
| **Products** | What they manufacture, specific items sold to LIDL | Confirms **why** this supplier is relevant. |
| **Business Relationship** | Direct or indirect supplier, years of engagement | Helps us **map their role in LIDL’s supply chain**. |
| **Annual Spend (if available)** | LIDL’s financial relationship with the supplier | Shows **LIDL’s dependency** on the supplier. |
| **Ownership** | Parent company, major shareholders (if available) | Identifies **who controls** the supplier. |
