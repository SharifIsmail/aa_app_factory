#### **Main Instruction for DeepResearch**  
```
Your task is to **gather and verify initial supplier data** for a specific company as part of the **LkSG Supplier Risk Assessment process**.  

🎯 **Objective:**  
- Ensure we are assessing the **correct supplier** before moving to risk analysis.  
- Identify **company name, locations, industry classification, ownership, and relationship with LIDL**.  
- **Do NOT** assess risks, certifications, or compliance at this stage. That will be covered in **Step 3**.  

🛠 **Cross-check data from multiple sources.**  
⚠️ If sources provide **conflicting information**, flag it as **unreliable or contradictory**.  
⚠️ If there is **too little evidence** to confirm a data point, mark it as **inconclusive** and indicate the missing details.

🔍 **Step 1: Gather Core Supplier Data**  
For each supplier, collect the following details:

| **Category**          | **Required Data**                                      | **Purpose** |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Company Identity** | Full legal name, alternative names, subsidiaries     | Confirms the exact entity being assessed. |
| **Location**        | Headquarters, factory locations, registered offices   | Identifies **where** the supplier operates. |
| **Industry**        | Official industry classification (e.g., textile, electronics) | Determines **what sector** the company operates in. |
| **Products**        | Items manufactured, products supplied to LIDL         | Confirms the relevance of this supplier. |
| **Business Relationship** | Direct/indirect supplier, years of engagement with LIDL | Maps their role in LIDL’s supply chain. |
| **Annual Spend (if available)** | LIDL’s financial relationship with the supplier | Shows **LIDL’s dependency** on the supplier. |
| **Ownership**       | Parent company, major shareholders (if available)     | Identifies **who controls** the supplier. |

⚠️ **Cross-Check Instruction:**  
- Verify **each data point** against **at least two independent sources**.

- **If a source is unclear, outdated, or unverifiable**, flag it as **low trust** and seek additional verification.

#### **Official Supplier Information Sources**

🔹 **Step 2: Search Official Databases**  
Use **official business registries** and **supplier websites** to confirm core details.  

📌 **Supplier’s Official Website**  
- Search for **company identity, factory locations, ownership details, and claimed certifications**.  
- Example URL format: `[company_name].com`  
- If no website is found, flag it as **"No official source available"**.  

📌 **Business Registries & Government Databases**  
- **Bangladesh Office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies (RJSC)**  
  🔗 [https://www.roc.gov.bd/](https://www.roc.gov.bd/)
