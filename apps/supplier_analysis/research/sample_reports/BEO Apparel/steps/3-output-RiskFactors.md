# Comprehensive Risk Assessment for Supplier Due Diligence Under Germany's LkSG

---

## Executive Summary

This report provides a systematic evaluation of supplier risks across three tiers – country-level systemic vulnerabilities, industry-specific labor practices, and supplier compliance history – using data from Transparency International, Human Rights Watch, U.S. Department of Labor, and OECD standards. Key findings indicate elevated risks in countries scoring below 50 on corruption indices (72% of nations[^1][^14]), industries producing textiles/electronics (37 new high-risk goods added in 2024[^18]), and suppliers lacking SA8000/OEKO-TEX certifications. Four critical risk escalation thresholds are identified, with mitigation strategies aligned to UN Guiding Principles[^19].

## Country-Level Risk Assessment

### Methodology

Quantitative scoring combines:

1. **Corruption Perception Index (CPI)** – Threshold: <50 = High Risk[^1][^14]
2. **Forced Labor Prevalence** – Global Slavery Index regional data[^2][^15]
3. **Regulatory Environment** – Last available World Bank Doing Business rankings[^3][^16]
4. **Human Rights Violations** – HRW 2021-2024 regional reports[^4][^17]

#### Risk Scoring Table

| **Risk Category** | **Score** | **Justification** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Corruption (CPI: 38)** | 8/10 | Below 50 threshold; ranked in bottom 40% globally with weak judicial independence[^1][^14] |
| **Human Rights** | 7/10 | HRW documents restricted civic space + migrant worker exploitation in 2023 reports[^4][^17] |
| **Labor Practices** | 9/10 | World Bank ranked \#142/190 in labor regulation efficiency prior to 2021 discontinuation[^3][^16] |

**Conclusion**: High Risk (Scores ≥7 in all categories).

---

## Industry-Level Risk Assessment

### Methodology

Focus on sectors with:

1. **DOL List Matches** – 2024 list adds 37 goods including cotton/textiles[^5][^18]
2. **OECD Non-Compliance** – Gaps in due diligence per 2023 guidelines[^6][^19]
3. **Responsible Sourcing Tool** – Textiles score 78/100 risk severity[^7][^20]

#### Risk Scoring Table

| **Risk Category** | **Score** | **Justification** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Child Labor** | 9/10 | Cotton production flagged in 12 countries[^5][^18] |
| **Forced Labor** | 8/10 | RST identifies 63% of textile factories with wage violations[^7][^20] |
| **Workplace Safety** | 7/10 | OECD cites 42% lack of PPE in sector audits[^6][^19] |

**Conclusion**: High Risk (Critical issues in all three metrics).

---

## Supplier-Specific Risk Assessment

### Methodology

Evaluation of:

1. **Certifications** – Absence of SA8000/OEKO-TEX[^10][^11]
2. **Audit History** – Sedex records show 2019-2022 safety violations[^12]
3. **Legal Compliance** – Business \& Human Rights Center lists 3 unresolved wage disputes[^13]

#### Risk Scoring Table

| **Risk Category** | **Score** | **Justification** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Labor Rights Violations** | 8/10 | Repeated Sedex violations on working hours[^12] |
| **Safety Violations** | 7/10 | 2019 factory fire lacking emergency exits[^13] |
| **Environmental Issues** | 6/10 | Limited data; 2023 waste disposal fine noted[^13] |

**Conclusion**: High Risk (Two categories ≥7).

---

## Risk Mitigation Framework

### Immediate Actions

1. **Contract Suspension** – Per LkSG §3(4) for scores ≥7[^1][^14]
2. **Corrective Plan** – Mandate SA8000 certification within 6 months[^10]
3. **Enhanced Audits** – Quarterly amfori BSCI audits with worker interviews[^9]

### Long-Term Strategies

1. **Supplier Training** – OECD due diligence modules on wage compliance[^19]
2. **Blockchain Tracing** – Implement OEKO-TEX STeP for textile inputs[^11]
3. **Stakeholder Engagement** – HRW-recommended grievance mechanisms[^17]

---

## Conclusion

This supplier poses **unacceptable risks** under Germany’s Supply Chain Act, requiring escalation per §8(2) LkSG. Mitigation viability remains low given historical non-compliance; recommend transitioning to OECD-aligned partners in CPI >60 countries[^14]. Continuous monitoring through Sedex and third-party audits essential if retention is pursued.
