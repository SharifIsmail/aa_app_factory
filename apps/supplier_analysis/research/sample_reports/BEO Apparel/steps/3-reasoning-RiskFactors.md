### **LkSG Supplier Risk Assessment – Step 3: Identify Risk Factors**  
**Exhaustive Training Guide for Interns**  

---

## **🔍 Why This Step Matters**  
Now that we’ve identified the supplier in **Step 2**, we move to assessing **risks associated with doing business with them**. This includes risks at three levels:  

1️⃣ **Country-Level Risks** – Corruption, human rights issues, labor practices.  
2️⃣ **Industry-Level Risks** – Child labor, forced labor, workplace safety in the supplier’s industry.  
3️⃣ **Supplier-Specific Risks** – The supplier’s own history of violations, fines, and worker complaints.  

Each risk is **quantified** with a score from **1 (low risk) to 10 (high risk)** based on trusted sources.  

---

## **🔹 Step A: Conduct a Country-Level Risk Assessment**  
**Why?**  
The country where the supplier operates impacts their risk level. A supplier in a country with weak labor laws and high corruption is **more likely** to engage in unethical practices.  

### **📌 Data Sources to Use**  
Visit each of these links and **record the country’s risk levels**:  

1. **Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI)**  
   🔗 [https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2023](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2023)  
   ✅ **What to Look For:** A score **below 50** indicates high corruption.  

2. **Global Slavery Index**  
   🔗 [https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/](https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/)  
   ✅ **What to Look For:** High prevalence of **forced labor or human trafficking** in the supplier’s country.  

3. **World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index** *(Last available version before discontinued in 2021)*  
   🔗 [https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data)  
   ✅ **What to Look For:** Countries **ranked poorly** tend to have **weak enforcement of labor and safety laws**.  

4. **Human Rights Watch Reports**  
   🔗 [https://www.hrw.org/publications](https://www.hrw.org/publications)  
   ✅ **What to Look For:** Reports on **government crackdowns, labor rights abuses, or business complicity in human rights violations**.

### **🔢 Assign a Country Risk Score (1-10)**  
Using the sources above, assign a **risk score**:  

| **Risk Category** | **Score (1-10)** | **Reasoning** |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Corruption** | [X] | Based on CPI score. |
| **Human Rights** | [X] | Based on HRW reports & Global Slavery Index. |
| **Labor Practices** | [X] | Based on HRW & World Bank data. |

---

## **🔹 Step B: Conduct an Industry-Level Risk Assessment**  
**Why?**  
Some industries have **higher risks of forced labor, unsafe working conditions, or child labor**. A garment manufacturer in Bangladesh has different risks than an electronics supplier in Germany.  

### **📌 Data Sources to Use**  
Check these industry-specific sources and **record risk levels**:  

1. **U.S. Department of Labor’s List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor**  
   🔗 [https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods)  
   ✅ **What to Look For:** Is the supplier’s industry listed? If yes, high risk.  

2. **OECD Due Diligence Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct**  
   🔗 [https://mneguidelines.oecd.org/due-diligence-guidance-for-responsible-business-conduct.htm](https://mneguidelines.oecd.org/due-diligence-guidance-for-responsible-business-conduct.htm)  
   ✅ **What to Look For:** Best practices for ethical business. Compare with supplier practices.  

3. **Responsible Sourcing Tool – Industry Risk Search**  
   🔗 [https://www.responsiblesourcingtool.org/visualizerisk](https://www.responsiblesourcingtool.org/visualizerisk)  
   ✅ **What to Look For:** Select the supplier’s industry and check **forced labor and supply chain risks**.

### **🔢 Assign an Industry Risk Score (1-10)**  
Using the sources above, assign a **risk score**:  

| **Risk Category** | **Score (1-10)** | **Reasoning** |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Child Labor** | [X] | Based on U.S. Department of Labor list. |
| **Forced Labor** | [X] | Based on Responsible Sourcing Tool. |
| **Workplace Safety** | [X] | Based on OECD Guidelines. |

---

## **🔹 Step C: Conduct a Supplier-Specific Risk Assessment**  
**Why?**  
Even if a **country and industry have risks**, an individual supplier may have **strong compliance programs** or, conversely, a **history of violations**.  

### **📌 Data Sources to Use**  
Check supplier-specific compliance records and **note any previous violations**:  

1. **Internal LIDL Audit Records** *(Check internal database, if available)*  

2. **Supplier-Provided Compliance Reports** *(Request from supplier directly, if applicable)*  

3. **Third-Party Audits & Certifications**  
   - **amfori BSCI (Business Social Compliance Initiative)**  
     🔗 [https://www.amfori.org/content/amfori-bsci](https://www.amfori.org/content/amfori-bsci)  
   - **SA8000 Social Accountability Standard**  
     🔗 [https://sa-intl.org/programs/sa8000/](https://sa-intl.org/programs/sa8000/)  
   - **OEKO-TEX (Textile Safety Certification)**  
     🔗 [https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/](https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/)  
   - **Sedex Supplier Ethical Data Exchange**  
     🔗 [https://www.sedex.com/](https://www.sedex.com/)  

4. **Business & Human Rights Resource Center – Supplier-Specific Reports**  
   🔗 [https://www.business-humanrights.org/](https://www.business-humanrights.org/)  
   ✅ **What to Look For:** **Past violations, fines, lawsuits, or worker complaints.**  

---

### **🔢 Assign a Supplier Risk Score (1-10)**  
Using the sources above, assign a **risk score**:  

| **Risk Category** | **Score (1-10)** | **Reasoning** |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Labor Rights** | [X] | Based on compliance reports & third-party audits. |
| **Safety Violations** | [X] | Based on industry reports & audits. |
| **Environmental Issues** | [X] | Based on Business & Human Rights Resource Center. |

---

## **Final Analysis: Should We Flag This Supplier?**  
🔹 If **any risk score is 7 or higher**, flag the supplier for **further investigation**.  
🔹 If **supplier violations exist**, but they have **remediated issues**, note corrective actions.  
🔹 If **no major risks are found**, move forward with the **next assessment stage**.

## **✅ Summary: How to Complete Step 3**
1️⃣ **Check country risk factors** (corruption, labor laws, human rights).  
2️⃣ **Assess industry-level risks** (child labor, forced labor, workplace safety).  
3️⃣ **Analyze supplier-specific risks** (audit reports, past violations).  
4️⃣ **Cross-check data and document findings**.  
5️⃣ **Assign a risk score (1-10) for each category** and flag high-risk suppliers.
