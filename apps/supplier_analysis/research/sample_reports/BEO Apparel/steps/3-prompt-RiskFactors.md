#### **🎯 Objective:**  
Your task is to **conduct a thorough risk assessment** for a supplier as part of the **LkSG Supplier Risk Assessment Process**.  

This step evaluates risks at three levels:  
1️⃣ **Country-Level Risks** (Corruption, human rights, labor laws)  
2️⃣ **Industry-Level Risks** (Child labor, forced labor, workplace safety)  
3️⃣ **Supplier-Specific Risks** (Audit reports, legal violations, environmental concerns)  

Each category must be **quantified with a risk score (1-10)** based on official sources.  
- **1-3:** Low risk  
- **4-6:** Moderate risk  
- **7-10:** High risk (requires escalation)  

---
### **📌 Step 1: Conduct a Country-Level Risk Assessment**  
Gather **country-specific data** to assess systemic risks affecting the supplier’s operations.  

#### **🔹 Data Sources to Check:**  
1. **Corruption Perception Index (CPI) – Transparency International**  
   🔗 [https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2023](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2023)  
   ✅ **Check the country’s CPI score** and assess corruption levels. If **below 50**, consider it high risk.  

2. **Global Slavery Index**  
   🔗 [https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/](https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/)  
   ✅ **Check for prevalence of forced labor and human trafficking in the country.**  

3. **World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index** *(Last available version before discontinued in 2021)*  
   🔗 [https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data)  
   ✅ **Check business environment rankings** – lower-ranked countries often have weak labor protections.  

4. **Human Rights Watch (HRW) Reports**  
   🔗 [https://www.hrw.org/publications](https://www.hrw.org/publications)  
   ✅ **Look for human rights violations, labor rights abuses, or business complicity.**

#### **🔢 Assign a Country Risk Score (1-10):**  
```
| **Risk Category** | **Score (1-10)** | **Justification (source-based)** |
|------------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| **Corruption** | [X] | Based on CPI score. |
| **Human Rights** | [X] | Based on HRW reports & Global Slavery Index. |
| **Labor Practices** | [X] | Based on HRW & World Bank data. |
```
⚠️ **If any category is rated 7 or higher, flag the country as high risk.**  

---
### **📌 Step 2: Conduct an Industry-Level Risk Assessment**  
Analyze risks associated with the **supplier’s industry (e.g., textile, electronics, agriculture, etc.)**  

#### **🔹 Data Sources to Check:**  
1. **U.S. Department of Labor’s List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor**  
   🔗 [https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods)  
   ✅ **Check if the supplier’s industry is flagged for forced/child labor.**  

2. **OECD Due Diligence Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct**  
   🔗 [https://mneguidelines.oecd.org/due-diligence-guidance-for-responsible-business-conduct.htm](https://mneguidelines.oecd.org/due-diligence-guidance-for-responsible-business-conduct.htm)  
   ✅ **Compare supplier industry standards against responsible business guidelines.**  

3. **Responsible Sourcing Tool – Industry Risk Search**  
   🔗 [https://www.responsiblesourcingtool.org/visualizerisk](https://www.responsiblesourcingtool.org/visualizerisk)  
   ✅ **Check industry risk levels for forced labor or human rights concerns.**  

---
#### **🔢 Assign an Industry Risk Score (1-10):**  
```
| **Risk Category** | **Score (1-10)** | **Justification (source-based)** |
|------------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| **Child Labor** | [X] | Based on U.S. Department of Labor report. |
| **Forced Labor** | [X] | Based on Responsible Sourcing Tool. |
| **Workplace Safety** | [X] | Based on OECD Guidelines. |
```
⚠️ **If any category is rated 7 or higher, flag the industry as high risk.**  

---
### **📌 Step 3: Conduct a Supplier-Specific Risk Assessment**  
Investigate **supplier-specific compliance records, legal violations, and ethical issues.**  

#### **🔹 Data Sources to Check:**  
1. **Internal LIDL Audit Records** *(If available, check for supplier audits and compliance history).*  

2. **Supplier-Provided Compliance Reports** *(Request and review, if applicable).*  

3. **Third-Party Audits & Certifications**  
   - **amfori BSCI (Business Social Compliance Initiative)**  
     🔗 [https://www.amfori.org/content/amfori-bsci](https://www.amfori.org/content/amfori-bsci)  
   - **SA8000 Social Accountability Standard**  
     🔗 [https://sa-intl.org/programs/sa8000/](https://sa-intl.org/programs/sa8000/)  
   - **OEKO-TEX (Textile Safety Certification)**  
     🔗 [https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/](https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/)  
   - **Sedex Supplier Ethical Data Exchange**  
     🔗 [https://www.sedex.com/](https://www.sedex.com/)  

4. **Business & Human Rights Resource Center**  
   🔗 [https://www.business-humanrights.org/](https://www.business-humanrights.org/)  
   ✅ **Look for supplier-specific violations, lawsuits, fines, or worker complaints.**  

---
#### **🔢 Assign a Supplier Risk Score (1-10):**  
```
| **Risk Category** | **Score (1-10)** | **Justification (source-based)** |
|------------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| **Labor Rights Violations** | [X] | Based on compliance reports & audits. |
| **Safety Violations** | [X] | Based on industry reports & audits. |
| **Environmental Issues** | [X] | Based on Business & Human Rights Resource Center. |
```
⚠️ **If any category is rated 7 or higher, flag the supplier for further review.**  

---
### **⚠️ Handling Conflicting or Unverified Data**  
- If **official sources contradict each other**, flag the data as **unreliable** and seek additional confirmation.  
- If **a supplier lacks certifications or refuses audits**, flag as **non-compliant**.  
- If **no data exists** on a specific risk category, mark it as **“Insufficient Data”** and recommend further investigation.  

---
### **✅ Final Decision: Should This Supplier Be Flagged?**  
- 🔹 If **any risk score is 7 or higher**, **escalate** for further investigation.  
- 🔹 If supplier **has past violations but corrective actions are in place**, note improvements.  
- 🔹 If **no major risks are found**, proceed to **Step 4: Mitigation & Recommendations**.
