**🔍 Assigning Risk & Recommending Corrective Actions**  

#### **🎯 Objective:**  
Your task is to **assign an overall risk rating** to the supplier and recommend **corrective actions** if necessary. This is based on the **Country-Level, Industry-Level, and Supplier-Specific Risk Scores** from Step 3.  

You must:  
1️⃣ **Calculate the final risk score** by averaging the three individual risk scores.  
2️⃣ **Determine the severity level** (Low, Medium, or High).  
3️⃣ **Identify key issues** that contribute to the risk score.  
4️⃣ **Recommend specific corrective actions** for any risks identified.  
5️⃣ **Set realistic deadlines** for improvements.  

The outcome of this step will determine whether:  
✔️ The supplier is **safe to work with** (Low Risk)  
⚠️ The supplier **needs further monitoring** (Medium Risk)  
🚨 The supplier **requires major improvements or disengagement** (High Risk)

## **🔹 Step 1: Assigning an Overall Risk Rating**  

### **📌 How to Calculate the Final Score**  
Each **risk category** (Country, Industry, Supplier-Specific) was scored **1-10** in Step 3.  
Now, **calculate the overall supplier risk** as an **average of these three scores**.  

✅ **Formula:**  
```
Final Score = (Country Risk Score + Industry Risk Score + Supplier Risk Score) ÷ 3
```
Use this formula to compute the final risk score.

### **📊 Risk Rating Table**  
Fill in this table using your risk assessments:  

| **Category** | **Score (1-10)** | **Severity** |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Country Risk** | X | Low / Medium / High |
| **Industry Risk** | X | Low / Medium / High |
| **Supplier-Specific Risk** | X | Low / Medium / High |
| **Final Score (Average)** | **[X]** | **Low / Medium / High** |

---

### **📌 How to Determine Severity**
**Convert the final score into a risk category:**  

| **Final Score** | **Severity** | **What It Means** |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **1 - 3** | ✅ **Low Risk** | Supplier operates in a low-risk environment, minimal concerns. |
| **4 - 6** | ⚠️ **Medium Risk** | Some concerns exist, but they can be addressed with proper controls. |
| **7 - 10** | 🚨 **High Risk** | Significant risks exist, requiring urgent mitigation before engagement. |

✅ **Low Risk** – The supplier is safe to work with. Proceed with normal contract procedures.  
⚠️ **Medium Risk** – The supplier needs **corrective actions** before engagement. Follow up at set deadlines.  
🚨 **High Risk** – The supplier **cannot be onboarded** until major risks are mitigated.  

⚠️ **If any category has a score of 7 or higher, flag the supplier for immediate corrective actions.**  

---

## **🔹 Step 2: Identifying Corrective Actions**  
If the supplier has a **Medium or High Risk rating**, identify specific issues and recommend **corrective actions**.  

### **📌 How to Identify Issues**  
Look at Step 3’s risk factors and determine:  
- **What are the key risk areas?** (Corruption, child labor, lack of audits, safety violations, environmental issues, etc.)  
- **Which category does each risk belong to?** (Country, Industry, or Supplier-Specific)  
- **What can the supplier do to fix these issues?**  

---

### **📊 Corrective Actions Table**  
Document specific **actions for each identified issue**:  

| **Issue** | **Corrective Action** | **Deadline** |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| [Issue 1] | [Action Plan] | [3 Months] |
| [Issue 2] | [Action Plan] | [6 Months] |

---

### **📌 Common Issues & Suggested Corrective Actions**
Use this as a guide when recommending actions:  

| **Issue Found** | **Example Corrective Action** | **Recommended Deadline** |
|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **High Corruption Risk (Country-Level)** | Require supplier to provide **third-party audit reports** on financial transactions. | **3-6 Months** |
| **Industry Linked to Forced Labor** | Demand supplier **prove compliance** with OECD & SA8000 guidelines. | **3-6 Months** |
| **No Supplier Safety Audits Available** | Require a **third-party safety audit (BSCI, Sedex, OEKO-TEX)** before contract renewal. | **3 Months** |
| **Supplier has history of worker complaints** | Implement **grievance mechanisms** for employees & conduct surprise inspections. | **6 Months** |
| **No environmental policies in place** | Require supplier to implement **sustainable production guidelines**. | **6 Months** |

✅ If a supplier refuses to take corrective actions, **escalate the case for review**.  
✅ If a supplier completes corrective actions successfully, **reassess risk after 3-6 months**.  

---

## **🔹 Step 3: Making a Final Recommendation**  
Once the **risk rating is assigned** and **corrective actions are outlined**, decide what to do with the supplier.  

| **Final Score (Risk Level)** | **Next Steps** |
|----------------------------|---------------|
| ✅ **Low Risk (1-3)** | Approve supplier with standard compliance monitoring. |
| ⚠️ **Medium Risk (4-6)** | Approve supplier **only with corrective actions** in place. Follow up at set deadlines. |
| 🚨 **High Risk (7-10)** | **Supplier is too risky**. Engagement should be delayed or declined **until major risks are mitigated**. |

⚠️ **If the supplier is high risk and refuses corrective action, disengage from the relationship.**

### **📌 How to Complete Your Job**
✅ **Step 1:** Review the **Country, Industry, and Supplier-Specific** risk scores.  
✅ **Step 2:** Calculate the **Final Score** (Average of the three scores).  
✅ **Step 3:** Assign a **Low, Medium, or High** risk rating based on the final score.  
✅ **Step 4:** Identify any **issues requiring corrective action**.  
✅ **Step 5:** Document an **Action Plan** for each issue with **clear deadlines**.  
✅ **Step 6:** Flag **high-risk suppliers** for **follow-up assessments** after deadlines.  

---

### **🚀 Final Decision: Approve, Monitor, or Reject?**  
At the end of this step, you should be able to provide **one of three recommendations**:  

✅ **Approve** – The supplier is **low risk**, proceed with normal engagement.  
⚠️ **Monitor** – The supplier is **medium risk**, but can proceed **with conditions** (corrective actions required).  
🚨 **Reject** – The supplier is **high risk**, and cannot be onboarded until major risks are addressed.  

---

## **🔜 Next Steps**
✅ If corrective actions are **completed**, reassess the supplier’s risk level after **3-6 months**.  
✅ If risks **remain high**, escalate to **procurement & compliance teams** for a **final decision**.  
✅ If no improvements occur, **supplier disengagement should be considered**.
