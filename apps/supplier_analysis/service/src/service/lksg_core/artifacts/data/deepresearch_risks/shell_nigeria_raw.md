# Supplier Risk Assessment: The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC)

## Supplier Information  
**Name:** The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC)  
**Location:** Nigeria (headquartered in Port Harcourt, with operations across the Niger Delta)  
**Industry:** Oil & Gas (Upstream exploration and production)  
**Products/Services:** Crude oil production and natural gas distribution (SPDC operates several oil fields, pipelines, and gas plants in joint venture with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and others) ([Nigeria leads in Shell's 2023 government payments after receiving ...](https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/markets/nigeria-leads-in-shells-2023-government-payments-after-receiving-dollar492-billion/znp4g9v#:~:text=Nigeria%20leads%20in%20Shell%27s%202023,billion%20to%20the%20Nigerian)).  
**Ownership:** Wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (Shell holds 30% interest in the SPDC joint venture) ([shel-20211231 - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1306965/000130696522000012/shel-20211231.htm#:~:text=The%20Shell%20Petroleum%20Development%20Company,after%20the%20completion%20of)).  
**Key Directors:** Osagie Okunbor (Managing Director), Ronald Adams, Ralph Gbobo (among others). *Okunbor is the Country Chair of Shell Companies in Nigeria, indicating local leadership.*  

## Data Sources Analyzed  
We conducted a broad review of **regulatory filings, compliance databases, and open-source reports** to evaluate SPDC’s risk profile. Sources included: 

- **Regulatory/Certification Bodies:** We checked social compliance frameworks (amfori BSCI, SA8000, Sedex) for any certification or audits involving SPDC – **no records were found** of SPDC in these initiatives, suggesting an absence of third-party social responsibility audits. Corporate registration was confirmed via Nigeria’s Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). We also reviewed government oversight bodies: Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) reports for transparency compliance, Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) for any listings, and the Nigeria Sanctions Committee (NIGSAC) for local sanctions – **no sanctions or debarments** were found for SPDC in Nigeria.  

- **International Sanctions Lists:** Major sanctions lists (UN, U.S. OFAC, EU, UK, World Bank debarment list) were reviewed. **SPDC is not listed on any current international sanctions or World Bank ineligible firms lists**, indicating the company itself is not under sanctions or global blacklisting. This suggests **formal compliance** with international sanctions regimes (e.g., no evidence of dealing with sanctioned entities). ([Shell paid FG $4.32bn for 2017 production entitlement](https://businessday.ng/exclusives/article/shell-paid-fg-4-32bn-2017-production-entitlement/#:~:text=Shell%20paid%20FG%20%244,in%20the%202017)) 

- **Environmental & Safety Compliance:** We analyzed Nigeria’s National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) Oil Spill Monitor data, NEITI oil & gas audit reports, and media/NGO reports on spills and safety incidents. We also reviewed community feedback via civil society platforms (e.g. BudgIT/Tracka) for on-the-ground perspectives.  

- **Legal & Financial Records:** We searched Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) public records for any fraud or corruption cases involving SPDC, as well as SEC Nigeria enforcement actions and the TRACE International bribery database for entries on Shell Nigeria. We also checked the ICIJ Offshore Leaks database for any Shell Nigeria-related offshore entities (none identified). Interpol Red Notices were scanned for any related individuals (none found).  

- **Media & NGO Reports:** Comprehensive reviews of independent reports from NGOs like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Transparency International, and the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre were conducted. These sources provided insight into SPDC’s track record on human rights, community impacts, and corruption allegations.  

Below, we summarize **key findings** from these sources, categorized by risk area. Each category is scored from 1 (lowest risk) to 10 (highest risk), and sources are cited for verification.

## Labor Rights Risk  
SPDC faces **moderate to high labor rights risk** (Score: **7/10**), primarily related to its treatment of local workers and contractors. While Shell’s parent policies espouse fair labor standards, evidence indicates gaps in implementation in Nigeria:

- **Fair Wages & Working Conditions:** A 2018/2019 investigation by IndustriALL Global Union revealed serious exploitation of contract workers in Shell’s Nigerian operations ([
      
  
    Nigeria: Union alleges exploitation of contract workers at Shell including anti-union activity, poverty wages, poor health & safety - Business & Human Rights Resource Centre
  

    ](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/nigeria-union-alleges-exploitation-of-contract-workers-at-shell-including-anti-union-activity-poverty-wages-poor-health-safety/#:~:text=A%20new%20report%20by%20IndustriALL,hazards%20and%20inadequate%20living%20conditions)). Contractors – who make up most of SPDC’s blue-collar workforce – reportedly receive *“poverty wages”* and endure delayed pay for months ([Shell worker abuses in Nigeria taken to UN Human Rights Council | IndustriALL](https://www.industriall-union.org/shell-worker-abuses-in-nigeria-taken-to-un-human-rights-council#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMy%20recruiter%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20pay%20on,%E2%80%9D)). One long-term contract worker said he was paid only ₦50,000 (≈$137) per month and went six months without wages, leaving him unable to feed his family ([Shell worker abuses in Nigeria taken to UN Human Rights Council | IndustriALL](https://www.industriall-union.org/shell-worker-abuses-in-nigeria-taken-to-un-human-rights-council#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMy%20recruiter%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20pay%20on,%E2%80%9D)). Such wages are far below a living wage, indicating non-compliance with fair compensation standards. Workers also reported *inadequate living conditions* in Shell’s contractor camps ([
      
  
    Nigeria: Union alleges exploitation of contract workers at Shell including anti-union activity, poverty wages, poor health & safety - Business & Human Rights Resource Centre
  

    ](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/nigeria-union-alleges-exploitation-of-contract-workers-at-shell-including-anti-union-activity-poverty-wages-poor-health-safety/#:~:text=A%20new%20report%20by%20IndustriALL,hazards%20and%20inadequate%20living%20conditions)).

- **Freedom of Association:** The same reports allege **anti-union practices**. Contract staff face dismissal if they attempt to join a union or ask for better pay ([Shell worker abuses in Nigeria taken to UN Human Rights Council | IndustriALL](https://www.industriall-union.org/shell-worker-abuses-in-nigeria-taken-to-un-human-rights-council#:~:text=%E2%80%9CContract%20workers%20at%20Shell%20Nigeria,%E2%80%9D)). This suggests violations of freedom of association and collective bargaining rights. No evidence was found of SPDC participating in labor accountability initiatives like amfori BSCI or SA8000 – an absence of external social audits that could otherwise verify compliance. 

- **Health & Safety for Workers:** Labor unions flagged *“health & safety hazards”* for Shell’s contract workers ([
      
  
    Nigeria: Union alleges exploitation of contract workers at Shell including anti-union activity, poverty wages, poor health & safety - Business & Human Rights Resource Centre
  

    ](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/nigeria-union-alleges-exploitation-of-contract-workers-at-shell-including-anti-union-activity-poverty-wages-poor-health-safety/#:~:text=A%20new%20report%20by%20IndustriALL,hazards%20and%20inadequate%20living%20conditions)). IndustriALL’s submission to the UN Human Rights Council noted that many contractors lack basic safety equipment and *“risk death in the field”* ([Shell worker abuses in Nigeria taken to UN Human Rights Council | IndustriALL](https://www.industriall-union.org/shell-worker-abuses-in-nigeria-taken-to-un-human-rights-council#:~:text=%E2%80%9CContract%20workers%20at%20Shell%20Nigeria,%E2%80%9D)). This indicates subpar enforcement of occupational safety standards for at least part of SPDC’s workforce, raising concerns about workplace injuries or fatalities going unaddressed. (Indeed, Shell Nigeria has historically outsourced hazardous work to labor contractors, complicating oversight of safety and labor conditions ([Shell worker abuses in Nigeria taken to UN Human Rights Council | IndustriALL](https://www.industriall-union.org/shell-worker-abuses-in-nigeria-taken-to-un-human-rights-council#:~:text=A%20recent%20IndustriALL%20mission%20to,unions%20and%20defend%20their%20rights)).)

- **Local Content & Training:** On a positive note, Shell Nigeria does engage many Nigerian employees and has local content programs. However, the heavy reliance on subcontractors for core operations ([Shell worker abuses in Nigeria taken to UN Human Rights Council | IndustriALL](https://www.industriall-union.org/shell-worker-abuses-in-nigeria-taken-to-un-human-rights-council#:~:text=A%20recent%20IndustriALL%20mission%20to,unions%20and%20defend%20their%20rights)) can dilute accountability for labor practices. There have been periodic strikes by oil workers in Nigeria (including at Shell’s operations) over working conditions and job security, underscoring ongoing labor tensions.

**Assessment:** The evidence points to **systemic labor rights issues**, particularly for contracted staff, including low wages, anti-union repression, and safety lapses. These issues pose reputational and operational risks (e.g., protests or production disruptions). The risk is moderated slightly by Shell’s global standards and the absence of known child labor or forced labor incidents in SPDC’s operations. Still, sustained allegations of worker mistreatment elevate this category to a **7/10** risk rating. Strengthening labor oversight in Shell’s supply chain and ensuring contractors adhere to Shell’s code of conduct is recommended to mitigate this risk.

## Safety Violations Risk  
Safety risk for SPDC is assessed as **moderate** (Score: **6/10**). The oil & gas sector is inherently high-hazard, and while Shell has global safety protocols, Nigeria’s operating context presents additional challenges (sabotage, oil theft, aging infrastructure). Key points:

- **Workplace Safety Performance:** Shell’s global safety data show some fatalities each year across operations ([Safety performance - Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2023](https://reports.shell.com/annual-report/2023/strategic-report/safety/safety-performance.html#:~:text=2023%20reports,from%20nine%20in%202022)). In Nigeria, no specific public breakdown is given, but reports of accidents imply ongoing concerns. Notably, contract workers have complained of inadequate safety gear (helmets, protective clothing) when working on pipelines and flow stations ([Shell worker abuses in Nigeria taken to UN Human Rights Council | IndustriALL](https://www.industriall-union.org/shell-worker-abuses-in-nigeria-taken-to-un-human-rights-council#:~:text=%E2%80%9CContract%20workers%20at%20Shell%20Nigeria,%E2%80%9D)). Such gaps increase the risk of on-the-job injuries. There have also been **fatal accidents** during operations. For example, Shell’s records indicate several contractor fatalities in past years during project work, though exact figures for SPDC are not publicly disclosed.

- **Pipeline Explosions & Community Safety:** A significant safety issue in Nigeria is pipeline vandalism and illegal refining, which have led to deadly explosions. SPDC’s pipelines have suffered such incidents, causing loss of life and environmental damage. In March 2023, an explosion on Shell’s Rumuekpe-Nkpoku trunk line in Rivers State sparked a massive fire, **killing at least 12 people** on site ([Blast at Shell's Nigeria oil pipeline kills 12 - police | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-oil-pipeline-blast-kills-least-one-niger-delta-2023-03-03/#:~:text=EMOHUA%2C%20Nigeria%2C%20March%203%20,had%20died%20in%20the%20blast)). The victims included local residents siphoning fuel; community members feared the death toll was higher. Shell confirmed the fire and cooperated with authorities on an investigation ([Blast at Shell's Nigeria oil pipeline kills 12 - police | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-oil-pipeline-blast-kills-least-one-niger-delta-2023-03-03/#:~:text=A%20spokesperson%20for%20Shell%20Petroleum,authorities%20to%20put%20it%20out)). This tragedy highlights how **sabotage and theft** can turn into major safety disasters. Similar accidents are frequent – pipeline fires in the Niger Delta (often from illicit bunkering) have killed dozens, and **in April 2022 a blast killed over 100 people** tapping an illegal site ([Blast at Shell's Nigeria oil pipeline kills 12 - police | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-oil-pipeline-blast-kills-least-one-niger-delta-2023-03-03/#:~:text=Oil%20theft%20and%20pipeline%20sabotage,in%20accidents%20that%20cause%20fires)). While many such incidents stem from criminal activity, they expose a safety risk *around* Shell’s operations and point to the need for tighter pipeline security.

- **Operational Safety & Spills:** Equipment failure can also pose risks. For instance, aging pipelines or flow stations that are not properly maintained could rupture. The UNEP audit of Ogoniland found Shell had not met key safety and maintenance standards in the past, leading to spills and pollution ([Decades of destruction: Shell in Nigeria – Oil Politics](https://pressbooks.pub/firoze/chapter/decades-of-destruction-shell-in-nigeria/#:~:text=The%20report%20also%20confirmed%20that,the%20laws%20of%20the%20land)). Poor maintenance not only causes environmental harm but also endangers workers and nearby communities. There have been reports of gas pipeline leaks and the risk of fires at flow stations, though Shell typically shuts down facilities when issues are detected. Nigeria’s regulatory enforcement of safety (formerly by DPR, now NUPRC) has been relatively weak, so much depends on Shell’s internal safety management systems.

- **Emergency Response Capacity:** SPDC maintains an Oil Spill Response and Firefighting unit, and it conducts regular drills. However, community feedback suggests response to incidents can be slow or inadequate, exacerbating harm. After the 2023 explosion, local officials urged Shell and the government to do more to secure infrastructure and **prevent dangerous oil theft** that leads to such accidents ([
        Deadly Fire at Shell Nigeria Pipeline That Feeds Bonny Crude | Rigzone    ](https://www.rigzone.com/news/wire/deadly_fire_at_shell_nigeria_pipeline_that_feeds_bonny_crude-06-mar-2023-172214-article/#:~:text=pilfered%20crude%20either%20processed%20domestically,Deadly%20accidents%20are%20frequent)). This implies a need for more proactive risk prevention (e.g., community engagement to curb vandalism, better surveillance of pipelines).

**Assessment:** SPDC’s **safety track record is mixed**. On one hand, Shell has global safety standards and there is no pattern of routine worker fatalities under normal operations. On the other, the Nigerian context introduces high safety risks (pipeline explosions, sabotage, contractor safety issues) that have resulted in loss of life. The **6/10** rating reflects that moderate improvements are needed: strengthening community surveillance programs, hardening facilities against tampering, and enforcing stringent safety measures for all workers (including contractors). Without these steps, SPDC remains vulnerable to further serious incidents.

## Environmental Issues Risk  
Environmental risk is **very high** for SPDC (Score: **9/10**). SPDC has a long history of oil spills, gas flaring, and environmental damage in the Niger Delta, attracting intense scrutiny from regulators, courts, and NGOs. Key findings:

- **Oil Spills – Frequency and Impact:** SPDC’s operations have been marred by thousands of oil spills over decades, causing severe pollution of land and water. Official data from NOSDRA (the federal oil spill monitor) shows that **from 2006 to March 2020, SPDC reported 3,421 oil spill incidents, releasing about 306,708 barrels of oil** ([
            Consistently unreliable: Oil spill data and transparency discourse - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7184024/#:~:text=incidents%20%2876.64,37)). This is an enormous volume (over 48.7 million liters) of hydrocarbons discharged into the environment. Shell’s Nigeria subsidiary alone accounted for roughly **26% of all spills in Nigeria by number** during that period ([
            Consistently unreliable: Oil spill data and transparency discourse - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7184024/#:~:text=incidents%20%2876.64,37)). The Niger Delta’s rivers and mangroves have been devastated: a UNEP scientific assessment in Ogoniland (2011) found pollution in groundwater and soil at levels hundreds of times above safety limits, with benzene (a carcinogen) at **900 times the WHO guideline** in drinking water ([Decades of destruction: Shell in Nigeria – Oil Politics](https://pressbooks.pub/firoze/chapter/decades-of-destruction-shell-in-nigeria/#:~:text=UNEP%20affirmed%20that%20pollution%20is,8cm%20of%20oil%20on%20it)). UNEP squarely criticized SPDC, concluding that Shell **“failed to meet the minimum requirements”** of Nigerian environmental laws and Shell’s own standards ([Decades of destruction: Shell in Nigeria – Oil Politics](https://pressbooks.pub/firoze/chapter/decades-of-destruction-shell-in-nigeria/#:~:text=The%20report%20also%20confirmed%20that,the%20laws%20of%20the%20land)). This indicates **systemic non-compliance** with environmental regulations and industry best practices in past operations.

- **Root Causes of Pollution:** Shell often attributes many spills to sabotage or oil theft, and indeed a portion are due to vandalism. However, investigations show that a substantial share stem from operational failures. Historical data revealed that in the early 1990s, **over 70% of oil spilled by Shell was due to corrosion and operational problems (only 28% due to sabotage) ([
            Consistently unreliable: Oil spill data and transparency discourse - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7184024/#:~:text=The%202013%20Amnesty%20report%20further,average%20of%20221%20spills%20per)).** Even in recent cases, courts have challenged Shell’s attribution of spills solely to sabotage. In a landmark Dutch court ruling (2021), **Shell’s Nigerian subsidiary (SPDC) was found responsible for failing to prevent spills** in Oruma and two other communities and ordered to compensate affected farmers ([Shell to pay 15 mln euros in settlement over Nigerian oil spills | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shell-pay-15-mln-euros-settlement-over-nigerian-oil-spills-2022-12-23/#:~:text=million%20euros%20%28%2415,of%20Friends%20of%20the%20Earth)) ([Shell to pay 15 mln euros in settlement over Nigerian oil spills | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shell-pay-15-mln-euros-settlement-over-nigerian-oil-spills-2022-12-23/#:~:text=The%20compensation%20is%20the%20result,pay%20for%20damages%20to%20farmers)). Shell was forced to pay €15 million in damages in that case ([Shell to pay 15 mln euros in settlement over Nigerian oil spills | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shell-pay-15-mln-euros-settlement-over-nigerian-oil-spills-2022-12-23/#:~:text=million%20euros%20%28%2415,of%20Friends%20of%20the%20Earth)). Notably, the court held Shell had not proven the spills were caused by third-party sabotage rather than poor maintenance ([Shell to pay 15 mln euros in settlement over Nigerian oil spills | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shell-pay-15-mln-euros-settlement-over-nigerian-oil-spills-2022-12-23/#:~:text=waterways%20in%20the%20region%2C%20the,heart%20of%20Nigeria%E2%80%99s%20oil%20industry)). This verdict undermines Shell’s defense and highlights maintenance lapses as a risk factor.

- **Legal Liabilities & Fines:** SPDC has incurred significant liabilities for environmental harm. Beyond the Dutch case, Shell has faced lawsuits in Nigerian courts: in 2021 it agreed to pay ₦45.9 billion (about **$111 million**) to the Ejama-Ebubu community to settle a **decades-old oil spill** case ([Shell to pay $111 million over decades-old Nigerian oil spill | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shell-pay-111-million-over-decades-old-nigerian-oil-spill-2021-08-11/#:~:text=Shell%20to%20pay%20%24111%20million,oil%20spill%20that%20took)). Other Niger Delta communities (e.g., Bodo in Ogoniland) have also received multi-million-dollar settlements after suing Shell in UK courts for massive spills. Additionally, Shell and other operators are subject to government fines for gas flaring and spills. Nigeria’s NEITI audits and media investigations reveal that companies, including SPDC, **owe large unpaid environmental penalties**. Analysis of government data from 2021–2023 shows Shell-operated licenses (e.g., OML 79 & 39) incurred about ₦23.2 billion in gas flaring fines (≈$50 million) that have not been paid to date ([Niger Delta communities suffer as oil giants fail to pay penalties](https://www.icirnigeria.org/gas-flaring-niger-delta-communities-suffer-as-oil-giants-fail-to-pay-penalties-part-2/#:~:text=In%20Ogun%20State%2C%20Alfred%20James,on%20OPL%20306%20and%20302)). This failure to pay mandated penalties deprives communities of remediation funds and signals shortcomings in regulatory compliance.

- **Gas Flaring & Emissions:** Gas flaring is another chronic issue. SPDC historically flared associated gas from oil wells, contributing to greenhouse emissions and local air pollution. While Shell has reduced flaring in many fields, progress has been slow. In fact, Shell admitted that its flaring in Nigeria **increased by 33% in 2010** versus the prior year ([Decades of destruction: Shell in Nigeria – Oil Politics](https://pressbooks.pub/firoze/chapter/decades-of-destruction-shell-in-nigeria/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20World%20Bank%2C,percent%20over%20their%202009%20figure)), citing lack of equipment and security issues as excuses ([Decades of destruction: Shell in Nigeria – Oil Politics](https://pressbooks.pub/firoze/chapter/decades-of-destruction-shell-in-nigeria/#:~:text=Shell%20claims%20to%20have%20reduced,We%20note%20that%20security)). Flaring has continued in parts of SPDC operations due to delayed gas capture projects. This violates Nigerian regulations (which technically ban routine flaring) and incurs fines (as noted above). The environmental impact on local communities is severe – constant gas flares have been linked to acid rain, respiratory issues, and poor crop yields in the Delta.

- **Current Status and Cleanup Efforts:** In recent years, Shell has made commitments to improve. It launched a spill transparency website and claims to respond faster to incidents ([Decades of destruction: Shell in Nigeria – Oil Politics](https://pressbooks.pub/firoze/chapter/decades-of-destruction-shell-in-nigeria/#:~:text=Shell%20would%20like%20us%20to,these%20transparency%20claims%20require%20interrogation)). Cleanup and remediation efforts are ongoing in some areas (for example, the Bodo cleanup project, and contributions to the Ogoniland Restoration Fund as recommended by UNEP). However, progress is slow and many sites remain polluted. The risk of new spills also persists as long as pipeline sabotage, oil theft, and aging infrastructure issues are not fully resolved. Notably, Shell Plc has announced plans to sell its onshore SPDC assets to a new owner ([Joint letter regarding Shell’s sale of the Shell Petroleum Development Company in Nigeria - Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr44/7922/2024/en/#:~:text=governmental%20organisations%2C%20urges%20the%20Nigerian,Company%2C%20to%20Renaissance%20African%20Energy)), partly due to the “operational risk” and liabilities in the Delta. Nigerian and international NGOs have urged regulators to ensure Shell addresses outstanding pollution before any sale ([Joint letter regarding Shell’s sale of the Shell Petroleum Development Company in Nigeria - Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr44/7922/2024/en/#:~:text=Joint%20letter%20regarding%20Shell%E2%80%99s%20sale,Petroleum%20Development%20Company%20in%20Nigeria)). This underscores that SPDC’s environmental risk is not only historical but also a **current, ongoing concern**.

**Assessment:** Given the **scale of past and present environmental damage**, SPDC’s environmental risk is extremely high. The company has a record of spills far above industry norms, with significant legal and cleanup liabilities. Regulatory compliance has been weak (e.g., failure to meet Nigerian standards per UNEP ([Decades of destruction: Shell in Nigeria – Oil Politics](https://pressbooks.pub/firoze/chapter/decades-of-destruction-shell-in-nigeria/#:~:text=The%20report%20also%20confirmed%20that,the%20laws%20of%20the%20land)), and unpaid fines). Community unrest and international pressure around environmental harm remain high, posing reputational and financial risks to any business relationship with SPDC. We assign a **9/10** risk score. Mitigating this would require robust environmental management: independent monitoring of SPDC’s pollution control, assurance of rapid spill response, investment in infrastructure upgrades, and full compliance with remediation obligations.

## Financial & Corruption Risk  
SPDC’s financial integrity and corruption risk is rated **8/10 (High)**. While Shell Nigeria is a major economic contributor with generally reliable financial operations, it has been embroiled in serious corruption scandals and exhibits some transparency gaps:

- **Corruption and Bribery Allegations:** The most notable case is the **OPL 245 oil block scandal**, one of the largest corruption cases in Nigeria’s history. In 2011, Shell (and Italian company Eni) paid **$1.3 billion** for the OPL 245 offshore block. Italian prosecutors later alleged that **most of this payment was siphoned off to Nigerian politicians and middlemen** as bribes ([Timeline: Nigeria's OPL 245 oilfield licence bribery cases | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/timeline-nigerias-opl-245-oilfield-licence-bribery-cases-idUSKBN2B92EA/#:~:text=LONDON%20%28Reuters%29%20,a%20Nigerian%20oilfield%20in%202011)). The money was routed via a company secretly owned by then-oil minister Dan Etete (Malabu Oil & Gas) ([Historic Nigerian court order against Shell and Eni after billion dollar ...](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/historic-nigerian-court-order-against-shell-and-eni-after-billion-dollar-corruption-probe-shows-exactly-why-us-transparency-law-must-be-protected/#:~:text=,owned%20by%20a%20former)) ([Timeline: Nigeria's OPL 245 oilfield licence bribery cases | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/timeline-nigerias-opl-245-oilfield-licence-bribery-cases-idUSKBN2B92EA/#:~:text=April%201998%3A%20The%20Nigerian%20government,former%20military%20ruler%20Sani%20Abacha)). This suggests SPDC’s parent and officials may have knowingly or negligently facilitated a vast transfer of illicit funds. In 2021, an Italian court *acquitted* Shell and Eni of criminal charges, citing insufficient proof to convict; however, the judge acknowledged the deal’s “unethical” aspects. The Nigerian government, for its part, canceled the OPL 245 licence and pursued its own legal actions. A Nigerian court even ordered the return of the block to the state, affirming that the sale was tainted by corruption ([Historic Nigerian court order against Shell and Eni after billion dollar ...](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/historic-nigerian-court-order-against-shell-and-eni-after-billion-dollar-corruption-probe-shows-exactly-why-us-transparency-law-must-be-protected/#:~:text=,owned%20by%20a%20former)). **Transparency International** and other watchdogs have insisted that authorities in the UK, US, and Netherlands continue investigations into Shell’s role despite the Italian acquittal ([Nigeria oil bribery case: Netherlands and US must reopen…](https://www.transparency.org/en/press/nigeria-oil-bribery-netherlands-us-reopen-investigations-eni-shells-opl245#:~:text=Nigeria%20oil%20bribery%20case%3A%20Netherlands,into%20Eni%20and%20Shell%27s%20role)). The OPL 245 saga highlights significant corruption risk – it implies willingness by Shell’s Nigerian subsidiary or partners to engage in opaque deals, which is a major red flag for ethical business conduct.

- **Fraud and Financial Crime:** Apart from OPL 245, there is no public evidence that SPDC itself has been prosecuted for fraud or financial crime in Nigeria. EFCC records show ongoing investigations into the oil sector (including the above case), but **SPDC has not been convicted of fraud**. It is worth noting that historically, allegations have surfaced about Shell Nigeria’s involvement in illicit payments – for example, past leaks (WikiLeaks cables) suggested Shell had improper relationships influencing government officials ([Decades of destruction: Shell in Nigeria – Oil Politics](https://pressbooks.pub/firoze/chapter/decades-of-destruction-shell-in-nigeria/#:~:text=stopping%20routine%20gas%20flaring)). However, no formal charges on those matters are documented. We found **no listing of SPDC on the World Bank’s debarment list** for fraud/corruption in procurement, further indicating no known sanction by multilateral banks. The **Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC)** records confirm SPDC’s proper registration and filings, and Shell’s annual reports consolidate SPDC’s financials, suggesting the company adheres to basic financial reporting standards (though as a private limited company, its financial statements are not public in Nigeria).

- **Tax and Royalty Compliance:** NEITI reports raise concerns about transparency in revenue reporting. Audits by NEITI revealed that Shell (and other operators) did **not fully disclose production volumes to the government** for oversight ([Decades of destruction: Shell in Nigeria – Oil Politics](https://pressbooks.pub/firoze/chapter/decades-of-destruction-shell-in-nigeria/#:~:text=Another%20example%20of%20Shell%E2%80%99s%20lack,distribution%20points%20is%20sheer%20mystery)). Essentially, Nigeria relies on oil companies to self-report output for calculating royalties and taxes, and Shell’s opacity in this area could facilitate underpayment. Indeed, Nigeria has struggled with oil theft and under-accounting – estimates suggest **up to 130,000–300,000 barrels per day** go unaccounted for in the country ([Decades of destruction: Shell in Nigeria – Oil Politics](https://pressbooks.pub/firoze/chapter/decades-of-destruction-shell-in-nigeria/#:~:text=Figures%20put%20forward%20for%20daily,Nigerian%20oil%20and%20gas%20sector)). NEITI has identified instances of payment discrepancies that required reconciliation between NNPC and Shell ([NNPC, Shell, others to reconcile oil payments with NEITI](https://sweetcrudereports.com/nnpc-shell-others-to-reconcile-oil-payments-with-neiti/#:~:text=NEITI%20sweetcrudereports,revenue%20from%20Nigeria%27s%20petroleum)). Additionally, gas flaring penalties (as noted earlier) were often treated as tax-deductible or simply not remitted, effectively cheating the treasury of revenue ([Nigeria | ieexi - World Bank](https://flaringventingregulations.worldbank.org/nigeria#:~:text=Fines%2C%20Penalties%2C%20and%20Sanctions%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%20Section,flared%2C%20vented%2C%20or%20wasted)). The Nigerian government is now tightening enforcement (e.g., the new Petroleum Industry Act makes gas flare fees non-deductible ([How does the Petroleum Industry Act protect our environment?](https://www.financialnigeria.com/how-does-the-petroleum-industry-act-protect-our-environment-blog-646.html#:~:text=How%20does%20the%20Petroleum%20Industry,The))). SPDC’s huge scale (Shell’s Nigerian operations paid **$4.92 billion to the government in 2023**, more than any other country ([Nigeria leads in Shell's 2023 government payments after receiving ...](https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/markets/nigeria-leads-in-shells-2023-government-payments-after-receiving-dollar492-billion/znp4g9v#:~:text=Nigeria%20leads%20in%20Shell%27s%202023,billion%20to%20the%20Nigerian))) means even minor compliance slippages have large financial implications. Overall, **financial transparency risk** exists in the form of potential underreported production and unpaid dues.

- **Sanctions Exposure:** As noted, SPDC itself is not sanctioned internationally. However, the broader Shell group has to navigate sanctions (for example, in 2022 Shell ceased operations involving Russian oil due to sanctions). In Nigeria, there have been calls by activists in the past for sanctions on Shell over human rights abuses (e.g., after the 1995 Ogoni executions). These have not materialized into formal sanctions, but the reputational risk remains. For our assessment, we consider that **no direct sanctions currently affect SPDC**, keeping the pure sanctions risk low.

- **Reputation and Governance:** The combination of the OPL 245 corruption cloud and community accusations of past collusion with corrupt officials (Shell’s alleged complicity in bribery and even human rights abuses during Nigeria’s military era) weigh heavily on SPDC’s reputation. In terms of corporate governance, Shell has compliance programs and has cooperated with investigations (the company claims to have improved controls after 2016 when it admitted learning that money from the OPL 245 deal went to Malabu). Still, the perception of operating in a high-corruption environment means a **heightened due diligence burden** for any partner dealing with SPDC.

**Assessment:** SPDC carries a **high corruption risk** due to its involvement in at least one major bribery scheme and ongoing transparency issues. Financial misreporting or disputes over payments also contribute to the risk rating. We assign **8/10**. This suggests that any engagement with SPDC should include strong anti-corruption clauses, close monitoring of transactions, and perhaps cooperation with initiatives like EITI to improve transparency. The company’s recent moves to divest onshore assets could be seen as partly driven by these above-ground risks, so any successor entity would need equally careful vetting.

## Risk Profile Summary (Scores 1–10)  

- **Labor Rights Risk:** **7/10** – Notable issues with fair wages, contractor treatment, and freedom of association. Needs improvement in labor conditions and compliance with international labor standards ([Shell worker abuses in Nigeria taken to UN Human Rights Council | IndustriALL](https://www.industriall-union.org/shell-worker-abuses-in-nigeria-taken-to-un-human-rights-council#:~:text=%E2%80%9CContract%20workers%20at%20Shell%20Nigeria,%E2%80%9D)) ([

- **Safety Violations Risk:** **6/10** – Moderate risk. Shell’s safety systems exist but are undermined by frequent pipeline explosions and occasional accidents, often linked to external sabotage ([Blast at Shell's Nigeria oil pipeline kills 12 - police | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-oil-pipeline-blast-kills-least-one-niger-delta-2023-03-03/#:~:text=EMOHUA%2C%20Nigeria%2C%20March%203%20,had%20died%20in%20the%20blast)). Strengthening preventive measures is necessary.  
- **Environmental Issues Risk:** **9/10** – Very high risk. History of oil spills, pollution, and inadequate remediation. Ongoing legal liabilities and community grievances underscore severe environmental non-compliance ([

- **Financial & Corruption Risk:** **8/10** – High risk. Past involvement in a grand corruption case (OPL 245) ([Timeline: Nigeria's OPL 245 oilfield licence bribery cases | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/timeline-nigerias-opl-245-oilfield-licence-bribery-cases-idUSKBN2B92EA/#:~:text=LONDON%20%28Reuters%29%20,a%20Nigerian%20oilfield%20in%202011)), with transparency gaps in operations. While not sanctioned, the company operates in a corruption-prone context requiring stringent controls.

*(Each score reflects the inherent risk level based on available information and is relative to industry norms. Higher scores denote greater risk exposure.)*

## Recommended Mitigation Actions  

**1. Strengthen Labor Standards & Oversight:** It is recommended that Shell Nigeria **formally undergo social compliance audits** and improve conditions for its contract workers. The company should consider participating in frameworks like **Sedex SMETA or SA8000** to certify labor practices. Key actions include ensuring all workers (including those employed via contractors) receive at least a living wage and on-time payments, and that freedom of association is respected. Regular independent audits of labor conditions should be conducted. Shell’s buyers or partners should incorporate clauses in contracts requiring adherence to Shell’s Business Principles on labor rights and allowing third-party inspections. Engaging with Nigerian labor unions (NUPENG, PENGASSAN) in a dialogue can also help address grievances proactively.  

**2. Enhance Workplace and Community Safety:** SPDC should **upgrade its safety protocols** and community risk management. This involves investing in pipeline surveillance technology (drones, sensors) to detect tampering early, reinforcing pipeline security (perhaps through community pipeline protection initiatives that provide local stakeholders with a vested interest in preventing vandalism), and working with law enforcement to clamp down on oil theft networks. Internally, Shell must ensure all personnel and contractors have proper PPE and safety training. We recommend a **zero tolerance for safety breaches**: every incident should be investigated by a joint team including regulators and community reps, and lessons learned implemented. For community safety, Shell could expand its community engagement and education programs about the dangers of illegal oil bunkering, to reduce the incidence of locals approaching pipelines. Improved emergency response capability (strategically placed fire equipment, spill response teams on standby) is also crucial given the history of accidents.  

**3. Environmental Management & Remediation:** Mitigating environmental risk requires a multi-faceted approach: **prevent, respond, remediate**. First, SPDC should accelerate replacement of old, corroded pipelines and upgrade infrastructure to reduce operational spills. Preventive maintenance must be prioritized and transparently reported to regulators. Second, Shell needs to maintain its commitment to transparency: the public oil spill tracker it launched should remain updated in real-time, and discrepancies between Shell’s data and NOSDRA’s should be jointly resolved to build trust. Third, and most importantly, **comprehensive remediation** of impacted sites must be completed. Ongoing cleanup projects (like in Ogoniland and Bodo) should be sped up with adequate funding and independent supervision (e.g., UN or reputable environmental NGOs oversight). We recommend Shell set aside sufficient provisions/reserves for environmental liabilities and perhaps establish an *environmental performance bond* that could be used by Nigerian authorities if Shell (or its successor) fails to remediate future spills. Gas flaring should be eliminated on an urgent timeline – Shell can install gas gathering facilities or reinject gas, as required by law, rather than flaring. Paying all outstanding gas flaring fines and investing in community development projects in affected areas would demonstrate good faith. **Regular environmental audits** by independent experts (possibly under NEITI or EITI+ environmental reporting standards) would also help in monitoring progress.  

**4. Anti-Corruption Controls and Transparency:** To address financial and corruption risks, SPDC (and any entity dealing with it) should implement **robust anti-bribery compliance programs**. This includes thorough due diligence on any joint venture partners, agents, or government intermediaries to ensure no illicit payments. All contracts and license transactions should be transparent – Shell should publish its petroleum contracts or at least the key terms, and fully comply with NEITI reporting by disclosing production volumes and all payments to the government (as Shell Plc already does in its annual Payments to Governments report). We recommend instituting a **monitoring mechanism** possibly via a third-party auditor or civil society observer group, to oversee that any transfer of assets (like the planned SPDC sale) does not absolve Shell of legacy cleanup or tax obligations. Companies engaging SPDC as a supplier should incorporate anti-corruption clauses (aligned with the U.S. FCPA and UK Bribery Act) in contracts, and require certification that no facilitation payments or political contributions are made on the company’s behalf. Given the OPL 245 aftermath, Shell should continue cooperating with authorities and could improve its internal whistleblower channels to catch any unethical behavior early. Partner companies should stay alert to any **politically exposed persons (PEPs)** involved in Shell’s dealings and conduct enhanced due diligence accordingly.  

**5. Ongoing Monitoring:** Finally, we advise maintaining a close watch on SPDC’s risk profile as situations evolve. For labor and safety, track any news of strikes, accidents or regulatory penalties. For environment, monitor NOSDRA’s spill reports and NGOs’ assessments; for instance, Amnesty International and local groups often publish updates on Shell’s environmental performance – these can serve as early warnings. For financial/corruption, watch for any new investigations (e.g., if Transparency International’s call leads to reopened cases ([Nigeria oil bribery case: Netherlands and US must reopen…](https://www.transparency.org/en/press/nigeria-oil-bribery-netherlands-us-reopen-investigations-eni-shells-opl245#:~:text=Nigeria%20oil%20bribery%20case%3A%20Netherlands,into%20Eni%20and%20Shell%27s%20role))) or any sanctions changes. Engaging with initiatives like the **Business & Human Rights Resource Centre** can provide updates on community allegations or company responses. This continuous monitoring will ensure that any deterioration in SPDC’s compliance triggers a reassessment of the supplier relationship if needed.  

**Conclusion:** In summary, The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria exhibits a **high-risk profile in environmental and corruption dimensions**, with moderate risks in labor and safety. These risks are tempered slightly by Shell’s global policies and recent efforts to improve transparency, but they remain significant. Any organization considering SPDC as a supplier or partner should proceed with caution and robust risk mitigation measures. Implementing the recommended actions above can help manage these risks. Additionally, a periodic re-evaluation of SPDC’s risk rating (say, annually or if a major event occurs) is prudent, to capture any improvements or new concerns. By doing so, stakeholders can ensure that engagement with SPDC aligns with their own compliance standards and sustainability commitments, thereby protecting both business interests and ethical responsibilities.
