## Key Risk Factors  

### 1. Corruption (**9/10 - High Risk**)  
Corruption is systemic in Nigeria, affecting business operations at all levels. Transparency International ranks Nigeria **145/180** in its 2023 CPI. [[Source](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2023/index/nigeria)] Bribery is common in procurement, licensing, and regulatory approvals. Companies must implement robust anti-corruption measures and third-party due diligence.  

### 2. Human Rights (**8/10 - High Risk**)  
Security forces frequently commit abuses, including extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. The **#EndSARS protests** highlighted police brutality. [[Source](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2023/country-chapters/nigeria)] Press freedom is declining, and digital censorship is increasing. Businesses should avoid complicity in human rights abuses.  

### 3. Labor Practices (**8/10 - High Risk**)  
Child labor is widespread, especially in agriculture and mining. [[Source](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/nigeria)] Forced labor and human trafficking remain persistent issues. Workplace safety enforcement is weak, leading to frequent industrial accidents.  

### 4. Political Stability & Governance (**7/10 - Significant Risk**)  
Nigeria has maintained democratic governance, but elections are frequently disputed. [[Source](https://freedomhouse.org/country/nigeria/freedom-world/2023)] The 2023 elections saw reports of voter suppression. Policy unpredictability, such as the removal of fuel subsidies, disrupts the economy.  

### 5. Security Threats (**9/10 - High Risk**)  
Nigeria faces terrorism from **Boko Haram and ISWAP**, mass kidnappings, and armed banditry. [[Source](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/nigeria.htm)] Over 3,500 kidnappings were recorded in 2023. Crime rates remain high in urban areas. Businesses should implement strict security protocols.  

### 6. Environmental Risks (**7/10 - Significant Risk**)  
Nigeria is vulnerable to flooding, desertification, and oil pollution. [[Source](https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-floods-2022-impact-assessment)] The **Niger Delta** suffers from chronic oil spills, with over 3,300 tonnes of crude leaked in 2021. Gas flaring continues to worsen air pollution.  

### 7. Economic Stability (**6/10 - Moderate Risk**)  
Nigeria's currency lost ~40% of its value in 2023. [[Source](https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/NGA)] Inflation remains high at ~25%. Foreign exchange shortages create challenges for imports. Despite volatility, Nigeria remains Africa’s largest economy.  

### 8. Health & Safety (**7/10 - Significant Risk**)  
Nigeria’s healthcare system ranks **187/191 globally**. [[Source](https://www.who.int/countries/nga/)] Industrial safety is poorly regulated, leading to thousands of workplace injuries annually. Pollution-related illnesses, such as respiratory diseases, are increasing.  

## Implications for LKSG Compliance  
Businesses operating in Nigeria must implement **enhanced due diligence**:
- **Corruption:** Zero-tolerance policies, third-party screening, and anti-bribery compliance frameworks.
- **Labor Rights:** Supply chain audits, independent labor inspections, and worker grievance mechanisms.
- **Human Rights:** Avoidance of high-risk security partnerships, commitment to human rights impact assessments.
- **Security Measures:** Personnel security training, secure transport arrangements, and emergency response plans.
- **Environmental Compliance:** Pollution monitoring, waste management controls, and adherence to international environmental standards.
- **Regulatory & Policy Risks:** Active engagement with local authorities, political risk insurance, and contingency planning for economic shocks.

**Conclusion:** Nigeria remains a **high-risk but strategically important** market. Companies must adopt **rigorous compliance frameworks, security protocols, and regulatory adaptability** to navigate the business environment effectively.
