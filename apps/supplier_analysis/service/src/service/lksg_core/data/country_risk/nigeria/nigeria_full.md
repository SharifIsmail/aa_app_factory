## 1. Corruption  

**Risk Score: 9/10 (High).** Corruption is endemic in Nigeria, posing a severe risk to businesses and compliance. Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) consistently ranks Nigeria among the most corrupt nations. In the latest CPI 2023, Nigeria scored only **25/100** (0 = most corrupt), ranking **145th of 180 countries**, well below the Sub-Saharan Africa average ([Why Nigeria recorded insignificant improvement in 2023 corruption perception ranking - TI, CISLAC](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/663743-corruption-ranking-why-nigeria-recorded-marginal-improvement-maintained-low-score-in-2023-cpi-cislac-ti.html#:~:text=Its%20new%20score%20of%2025,African%20average%20of%2033%20points)) ([Why Nigeria recorded insignificant improvement in 2023 corruption perception ranking - TI, CISLAC](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/663743-corruption-ranking-why-nigeria-recorded-marginal-improvement-maintained-low-score-in-2023-cpi-cislac-ti.html#:~:text=The%20CPI%20uses%20a%20scale,150th%20in%20the%202022%20CPI)). This score has hovered in the low 20s for a decade, indicating **persistent, systemic corruption** with no significant improvement ([Why Nigeria recorded insignificant improvement in 2023 corruption perception ranking - TI, CISLAC](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/663743-corruption-ranking-why-nigeria-recorded-marginal-improvement-maintained-low-score-in-2023-cpi-cislac-ti.html#:~:text=means%20%E2%80%9Cvery%20clean%E2%80%9D,150th%20in%20the%202022%20CPI)) ([Why Nigeria recorded insignificant improvement in 2023 corruption perception ranking - TI, CISLAC](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/663743-corruption-ranking-why-nigeria-recorded-marginal-improvement-maintained-low-score-in-2023-cpi-cislac-ti.html#:~:text=SUPPORT%20NOW%20x%20Do%20this,later)). Despite an anti-graft legal framework, enforcement is weak and bribery is considered “the norm” in many transactions ([Nigeria country risk report | GAN Integrity](https://www.ganintegrity.com/country-profiles/nigeria/#:~:text=Corruption%20is%20a%20significant%20obstacle,in%20practice%2C%20gifts%2C%20bribery%20and)). 

- **Government:** Public sector corruption is rampant. Grand corruption cases regularly involve diversion of public funds and contract fraud. For example, **up to one-third of companies expect to pay bribes or “gifts” to secure government contracts** ([Nigeria country risk report | GAN Integrity](https://www.ganintegrity.com/country-profiles/nigeria/#:~:text=match%20at%20L438%20Corruption%20is,diversion%20of%20public%20funds%20to)). Public procurement is a high-risk area – irregular payments in bidding are **very common** ([Nigeria country risk report | GAN Integrity](https://www.ganintegrity.com/country-profiles/nigeria/#:~:text=Corruption%20is%20common%20in%20Nigeria%27s,diversion%20of%20public%20funds%20to)) despite procurement reforms. Anti-corruption agencies exist, but political interference often undermines investigations. High-profile efforts (e.g. a **2016 anti-corruption summit commitment**) yielded only fleeting progress ([Why Nigeria recorded insignificant improvement in 2023 corruption perception ranking - TI, CISLAC](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/663743-corruption-ranking-why-nigeria-recorded-marginal-improvement-maintained-low-score-in-2023-cpi-cislac-ti.html#:~:text=Its%20scores%20have%20hovered%20between,and%2028%20in%2010%20years)) ([Why Nigeria recorded insignificant improvement in 2023 corruption perception ranking - TI, CISLAC](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/663743-corruption-ranking-why-nigeria-recorded-marginal-improvement-maintained-low-score-in-2023-cpi-cislac-ti.html#:~:text=But%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20scores%20have,report%20to%20score%2025%20points)). Nigeria’s oil sector is notorious: billions in oil revenues have been misappropriated over years. 

- **Judiciary:** The judicial system presents **very high corruption risk** ([Nigeria country risk report | GAN Integrity](https://www.ganintegrity.com/country-profiles/nigeria/#:~:text=Companies%20face%20a%20high%20risk,2016)). Businesses report that court officials solicit bribes for favorable judgments ([Nigeria country risk report | GAN Integrity](https://www.ganintegrity.com/country-profiles/nigeria/#:~:text=Companies%20face%20a%20high%20risk,2016)). Political actors also manipulate the judiciary; for instance, the Chief Justice was controversially suspended on corruption charges before the 2019 election ([BTI 2024 Nigeria Country Report: BTI 2024](https://bti-project.org/en/reports/country-report/NGA#:~:text=recommendation%20of%20the%20National%20Judicial,and%20confirmation%20by%20the%20Senate)), seen by some as executive interference. Lower courts suffer from graft that undermines contract enforcement and rule of law. Companies cannot rely on impartial dispute resolution due to **“a high degree of corruption and political interference” in courts ([Nigeria country risk report | GAN Integrity](https://www.ganintegrity.com/country-profiles/nigeria/#:~:text=Companies%20face%20a%20high%20risk,2016)). 

- **Business and Police:** Everyday business operations face **petty corruption** at many levels. Bribes are routinely demanded for permits, customs clearance, and basic public services ([Nigeria country risk report | GAN Integrity](https://www.ganintegrity.com/country-profiles/nigeria/#:~:text=Corruption%20is%20a%20significant%20obstacle,in%20practice%2C%20gifts%2C%20bribery%20and)). The police and customs are repeatedly cited as among the most corrupt institutions – extortion at roadblocks and ports is common. According to a UNODC survey, Nigerians pay hundreds of billions of naira in small bribes annually to public officials ([Nigeria: Amnesty activists uncover serious negligence by oil giants ...](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/03/nigeria-amnesty-activists-uncover-serious-negligence-by-oil-giants-shell-and-eni/#:~:text=Nigeria%3A%20Amnesty%20activists%20uncover%20serious,OMER%20MESSINGER%2FAFP%20via%20Getty%20Images)) ([Shell's wildly inaccurate reporting of Niger Delta oil spill exposed](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2012/04/shell-s-wildly-inaccurate-reporting-niger-delta-oil-spill-exposed-2012-04-2/#:~:text=Images%20of%20the%202008%20Bodo,out%20by%20Accufacts%20Inc)). This raises legal risks for companies under anti-bribery laws. Regional variations exist mostly in **scale rather than type** – for example, port cities (Lagos, Port Harcourt) see high-level oil theft and smuggling corruption, while some northern states struggle with local embezzlement. However, **corruption permeates all regions and sectors** ([Nigeria country risk report | GAN Integrity](https://www.ganintegrity.com/country-profiles/nigeria/#:~:text=Corruption%20is%20a%20significant%20obstacle,in%20practice%2C%20gifts%2C%20bribery%20and)), from federal ministries down to local agencies. 

**Trends:** Nigeria’s CPI score actually **declined to its lowest point (24)** in 2021–2022 ([Why Nigeria recorded insignificant improvement in 2023 corruption perception ranking - TI, CISLAC](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/663743-corruption-ranking-why-nigeria-recorded-marginal-improvement-maintained-low-score-in-2023-cpi-cislac-ti.html#:~:text=The%20CPI%20uses%20a%20scale,150th%20in%20the%202022%20CPI)) ([Why Nigeria recorded insignificant improvement in 2023 corruption perception ranking - TI, CISLAC](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/663743-corruption-ranking-why-nigeria-recorded-marginal-improvement-maintained-low-score-in-2023-cpi-cislac-ti.html#:~:text=But%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20scores%20have,report%20to%20score%2025%20points)), reflecting rising corruption or improved perception of it. In 2023 it inched up to 25 ([Why Nigeria recorded insignificant improvement in 2023 corruption perception ranking - TI, CISLAC](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/663743-corruption-ranking-why-nigeria-recorded-marginal-improvement-maintained-low-score-in-2023-cpi-cislac-ti.html#:~:text=Its%20new%20score%20of%2025,African%20average%20of%2033%20points)) after minor measures (e.g. launching a Beneficial Ownership registry) were implemented. Overall, the trend is stagnation – **“scores have only fallen and frozen”** in recent years ([Why Nigeria recorded insignificant improvement in 2023 corruption perception ranking - TI, CISLAC](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/663743-corruption-ranking-why-nigeria-recorded-marginal-improvement-maintained-low-score-in-2023-cpi-cislac-ti.html#:~:text=SUPPORT%20NOW%20x%20Do%20this,later)). Anti-corruption campaigns (such as under former President Buhari) had limited effect on entrenched practices ([Why Nigeria recorded insignificant improvement in 2023 corruption perception ranking - TI, CISLAC](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/663743-corruption-ranking-why-nigeria-recorded-marginal-improvement-maintained-low-score-in-2023-cpi-cislac-ti.html#:~:text=Its%20scores%20have%20hovered%20between,and%2028%20in%2010%20years)). Without sustained enforcement, the risk of corruption remains **extremely high**, jeopardizing supply chain integrity and legal compliance for companies. 

**Implications:** For LKSG due diligence, Nigeria’s corruption risk demands robust anti-corruption controls. Companies should implement strict **zero-tolerance policies, third-party due diligence, and transparency measures** when operating or sourcing in Nigeria. Engaging local civil society and using technology (e.g. e-procurement, e-payments) can help mitigate some bribery risks. Nonetheless, the **residual risk is 9/10**, requiring continuous monitoring and contingency plans. (See **References**: Transparency International CPI reports ([Why Nigeria recorded insignificant improvement in 2023 corruption perception ranking - TI, CISLAC](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/663743-corruption-ranking-why-nigeria-recorded-marginal-improvement-maintained-low-score-in-2023-cpi-cislac-ti.html#:~:text=The%20CPI%20uses%20a%20scale,150th%20in%20the%202022%20CPI)), GAN Integrity report ([Nigeria country risk report | GAN Integrity](https://www.ganintegrity.com/country-profiles/nigeria/#:~:text=Corruption%20is%20a%20significant%20obstacle,in%20practice%2C%20gifts%2C%20bribery%20and)), Premium Times/TI commentary ([Why Nigeria recorded insignificant improvement in 2023 corruption perception ranking - TI, CISLAC](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/663743-corruption-ranking-why-nigeria-recorded-marginal-improvement-maintained-low-score-in-2023-cpi-cislac-ti.html#:~:text=Nigeria%20added%20one%20point%20to,TI%29%20on%20Tuesday)).)

## 2. Human Rights  

**Risk Score: 8/10 (High).** Nigeria faces significant human rights challenges, creating high risk for companies under the LKSG’s human rights due diligence requirements. While Nigeria is a democracy, **rights abuses are frequent** – both by state actors and due to weak rule of law. Key concerns include **restrictions on free expression, police/military brutality, and discrimination** against vulnerable groups. Businesses may be exposed if they or their partners are complicit in such abuses or if operations inadvertently contribute to violations.

- **Freedom of Expression & Repression:** The government has **restricted criticism and protests** at times. A notable example was the October 2020 **#EndSARS protests** against police brutality – security forces opened fire on unarmed demonstrators at the Lekki Toll Gate, killing at least 11–12 people ([Nigerian Authorities Dismiss Lagos Panel Report on Lekki Shooting](https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerian-authorities-dismiss-lagos-panel-report-on-lekki-shooting/6324691.html#:~:text=Shooting%20www,killing%20at%20least%2011)). To date, **no accountability** has been imposed for this incident, reflecting impunity. Press freedom has also eroded. Reporters Without Borders downgraded Nigeria’s press freedom in 2021 due to **arbitrary arrests of journalists, outlet closures, and online censorship** ([BTI 2024 Nigeria Country Report: BTI 2024](https://bti-project.org/en/reports/country-report/NGA#:~:text=houses%20are%20often%20dependent%20on,sectarian%20hate%20speech%20%E2%80%93%20a)). The government infamously **banned Twitter for seven months in 2021** after the platform removed a presidential tweet ([BTI 2024 Nigeria Country Report: BTI 2024](https://bti-project.org/en/reports/country-report/NGA#:~:text=government%20interference,the%20balance%20has%20increasingly%20tilted)), gravely undermining digital freedom. Authorities often cite “fake news” or security as reasons for clamping down, but observers note an increasing tilt toward outright **censorship and silencing of dissent** ([BTI 2024 Nigeria Country Report: BTI 2024](https://bti-project.org/en/reports/country-report/NGA#:~:text=arbitrary%20arrests%20of%20journalists%20and,the%20balance%20has%20increasingly%20tilted)). Activists and opposition voices risk harassment or detention under broad laws (e.g. cybercrimes and terrorism acts). This climate poses reputational and legal risks for companies (especially media and tech) and their supply chains in Nigeria.

- **Extraterritorial Abuses & Security Forces:** Nigeria’s security forces (military and police) have a **documented history of human rights violations**, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and enforced disappearances ([BTI 2024 Nigeria Country Report: BTI 2024](https://bti-project.org/en/reports/country-report/NGA#:~:text=match%20at%20L1600%20country%2C%20such,wrist%20statements%20have%20been%20issued)). The **army’s heavy-handed operations** against insurgents have at times led to civilian casualties and alleged abuses (e.g. reports of mass unlawful detention and even a forced abortion program in the northeast conflict, per investigative reports in 2022). Police brutality and misconduct – the original spark for #EndSARS – remain concerns; units like the disbanded SARS were implicated in systematic torture and extortion. The U.S. State Department’s 2022 Human Rights Report noted **significant problems with police use of lethal force and lack of accountability** for officers ([[PDF] NIGERIA 2023 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT - Department of State](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/528267_NIGERIA-2023-HUMAN-RIGHTS-REPORT.pdf#:~:text=Freedom%20of%20Expression%3A%20There%20were,Critics%20of%20the)). For businesses, this raises risk if reliance on public security forces leads to complicity in abuses (for instance, if a company calls on police for strike-breaking or site security and violence occurs). Under LKSG, companies must assess these scenarios.

- **Discrimination and Social Rights:** There are serious human rights issues regarding discrimination in Nigeria. **Gender inequality** is pronounced – violence against women (such as domestic abuse) is common and legal protections are weak. In northern regions, women and girls face early marriage and limitations on education ([Girls suffer most as Nigeria kidnap scourge hits school attendance | Context](https://www.context.news/socioeconomic-inclusion/girls-suffer-most-as-nigeria-kidnap-scourge-hits-school-attendance#:~:text=Due%20to%20the%20kidnapping%20crisis%2C,often%20expected%20to%20marry%20young)). **LGBT+ rights are highly restricted**: same-sex relationships are criminalized (up to 14 years imprisonment) by a 2014 law, and LGBT individuals experience harassment and violence with little police protection. Ethnic and religious tensions also occasionally fuel rights abuses – for example, sectarian clashes or the persecution of minority groups in certain areas (such as the targeting of Shia Islamic Movement members by authorities, or communal violence against Christian farmers/Muslim herders in central states). Moreover, **freedom of assembly** can be curtailed: beyond the 2020 protest crackdown, authorities have at times banned or violently dispersed demonstrations (e.g. IPOB separatist rallies in the southeast). 

- **Corporate Involvement:** Multinational companies in Nigeria have in past been linked to human rights harms. In the oil-rich Niger Delta, communities have suffered from oil spills and pollution affecting their health and livelihood – a human rights issue often attributed to negligence by oil majors. There are precedents like the **Ken Saro-Wiwa case** in the 1990s, where activists were executed after protesting Shell’s environmental practices (Shell faced allegations of complicity). While that is historical, it underscores that **environmental mismanagement can translate to human rights violations** (right to health, clean environment). Today, companies operating in conflict areas (e.g. extractives in the northeast or Middle Belt) must guard against indirectly funding armed groups or using private security forces that might commit abuses. Under LKSG, companies should conduct human rights impact assessments and ensure their operations do not contribute to government policy abuses or discriminatory practices.

**Recent Developments:** On a positive note, Nigeria passed a new **Police Act in 2020** aimed at reforms, and states have set up judicial panels to investigate SARS abuses (though implementation of recommendations is slow). Civil society and a free press (where it exists) continue to expose abuses, pressuring the government. For example, in late 2023, leaked memos and media reports revived scrutiny of the Lekki Toll Gate killings ([2020 Lekki shooting - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Lekki_shooting#:~:text=On%20the%20night%20of%2020,the%20Lekki%20toll%20gate)), keeping the call for justice alive. However, the overall trajectory shows **ongoing risks**. In 2023, Amnesty International reported that **authorities still employed security forces to suppress protests and critics**, and **mass kidnapping of schoolchildren by armed groups (see Security Threats) also creates human rights crises** (children’s right to education and safety) ([Girls suffer most as Nigeria kidnap scourge hits school attendance | Context](https://www.context.news/socioeconomic-inclusion/girls-suffer-most-as-nigeria-kidnap-scourge-hits-school-attendance#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20U,miss%20out%20on%20an%20education)) ([Girls suffer most as Nigeria kidnap scourge hits school attendance | Context](https://www.context.news/socioeconomic-inclusion/girls-suffer-most-as-nigeria-kidnap-scourge-hits-school-attendance#:~:text=Aid%20workers%20say%20it%20is,number%20at%20more%20than%201%2C500)). Until the government firmly addresses security force impunity and strengthens rule of law, Nigeria’s human rights risk remains high. We assign **8/10** due to the breadth and severity of issues, which demand enhanced due diligence (e.g. robust supplier codes of conduct, community engagement, and grievance mechanisms for rights complaints).

## 3. Labor Practices  

**Risk Score: 8/10 (High).** Labor practices in Nigeria pose a high risk, especially in supply chains involving agriculture, mining, or informal manufacturing. Key concerns include **child labor, forced labor**, inadequate wages, and poor working conditions. Nigeria’s labor laws exist on paper (prohibiting forced labor, setting 12 years as minimum age for light work, etc.), but **enforcement is weak** – the country lacks sufficient labor inspectors and many workers are in the informal sector not covered by regulations ([Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Nigeria | U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/nigeria#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20Nigeria%20made%20minimal,cover%20the%20labor%20force%20and)). 

- **Child Labor:** Nigeria has one of the highest rates of child labor in the world. **Millions of children (often 30–50% of children in some age groups) are engaged in child labor** according to UNICEF and Nigeria’s National Bureau of Statistics ([[PDF] REgISTERINg children's identities at birth - Unicef](https://www.unicef.org/nigeria/sites/unicef.org.nigeria/files/2018-09/Nigeria-equity-profile-protection.pdf#:~:text=,is%20highest%20among%20the)) ([US Department of Labor awards $4M grant to combat child labor in ...](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20221213#:~:text=labor%20in%20Africa%20than%20in,In%20the)). The U.S. Department of Labor classifies Nigeria’s progress on eliminating worst forms of child labor as “minimal” ([Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Nigeria | U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/nigeria#:~:text=Minimal%20Advancement)). Children as young as 5 engage in agriculture, street hawking, mining, domestic servitude, and other hazardous work. A **2021 national survey** confirmed the link between high poverty and child work, especially in northern rural regions ([[PDF] Nigeria Child Labour - Survey 2022 - National Bureau of Statistics](https://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/pdfuploads/CHILD%20LABOUR%20REPORT%20FINAL.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20Nigeria%20Child%20Labour%20,health%20access%20and%20poverty)). Sectors identified with **child labor in Nigeria include**: **cocoa farming, artisanal gold mining, granite and gravel quarries, cassava farming, and textile manufacturing** ([Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Nigeria | U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/nigeria#:~:text=Image%3A%20Cocoa)) ([Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Nigeria | U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/nigeria#:~:text=Image%3A%20Gold)). These often feed into global supply chains. For instance, Nigerian cocoa (used in chocolate) and mined minerals have been flagged for child labor risks by the DOL. Moreover, **children have been forcibly recruited by non-state armed groups** (Boko Haram has abducted children as soldiers or “wives”), which is a worst form of child labor in conflict zones.

- **Forced Labor and Trafficking:** **Modern slavery is a serious concern**. An estimated **1.6 million people** in Nigeria were living in modern slavery on any given day in 2021 (7.8 per 1,000 people), the 5th highest prevalence in Africa ([Modern slavery in Nigeria | Walk Free](https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/country-studies/nigeria/#:~:text=The%202023%20Global%20Slavery%20Index,in%20modern%20slavery%20in%20Nigeria)). Forced labor occurs in various forms. **Men and boys** are coerced or trafficked into **street vending, domestic servitude, mining/quarrying, agriculture, and factory work** ([Modern slavery in Nigeria | Walk Free](https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/country-studies/nigeria/#:~:text=)). **Women and girls** are often trapped in domestic servitude or sex trafficking; some are trafficked abroad (e.g. to Europe) under false pretenses and then held in debt bondage ([Modern slavery in Nigeria | Walk Free](https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/country-studies/nigeria/#:~:text=,of%20adults)). In Nigeria’s own cities, it is not uncommon to find “housegirls” – underage domestic workers from rural areas – working in slavery-like conditions (excessive hours, abuse, no pay) ([Modern slavery in Nigeria | Walk Free](https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/country-studies/nigeria/#:~:text=sector,such%20as%20excessive%20hours%2C%20sexual)) ([Modern slavery in Nigeria | Walk Free](https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/country-studies/nigeria/#:~:text=trafficked%20from%20both%20within%20Nigeria,10)). The Global Slavery Index notes Nigeria has **the strongest legal response in Africa** on paper, but big gaps remain (e.g. not all states forbid child begging or certain exploitative practices) ([Modern slavery in Nigeria | Walk Free](https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/country-studies/nigeria/#:~:text=mechanisms%20to%20address%20modern%20slavery%2C,modern%20slavery%20in%20the%20region)). Trafficking networks, including some involving corrupt officials, continue to operate. For companies, this means **high risk in sectors like construction, mining, agriculture, and hospitality**, where forced labor or human trafficking victims might be present in the workforce of suppliers or subcontractors.

- **Workplace Conditions and Wages:** Nigeria’s minimum wage is ₦30,000/month (≈$65) as of 2019, but inflation and currency devaluation have eroded its value. Many employers (especially in the informal economy and at state levels) do not pay even this minimum. **Wage theft and informal, uncontracted labor are common**, leaving workers unprotected. Occupational health and safety standards are inadequately enforced. **Industrial accidents** occur frequently – over **4,900 workplace accidents were recorded from 2012–2017** (about 1,000 per year) ([With No Training, I Risked Fingers, Hearing to Make Plastic Bottles](https://fij.ng/article/special-report-i-risked-fingers-hearing-to-make-plastic-bottles-at-cascade-waters-for-n1500-pay/#:~:text=Data%20on%20workplace%20safety%20in,nearly%201%2C000%20cases%20each%20year)), including fatal incidents in factories. Notably, Nigerian factories have seen incidents where workers were maimed or killed by unsafe machinery, with companies often evading accountability ([With No Training, I Risked Fingers, Hearing to Make Plastic Bottles](https://fij.ng/article/special-report-i-risked-fingers-hearing-to-make-plastic-bottles-at-cascade-waters-for-n1500-pay/#:~:text=In%20the%20last%2015%20years%2C,Henkel%20Industries%20in%20Oyo%20State)) ([With No Training, I Risked Fingers, Hearing to Make Plastic Bottles](https://fij.ng/article/special-report-i-risked-fingers-hearing-to-make-plastic-bottles-at-cascade-waters-for-n1500-pay/#:~:text=There%20are%20also%20those%20who,how%20such%20injuries%20could%20occur)). The **construction sector** is similarly dangerous with little oversight, contributing to frequent building collapses and worker deaths. Unions do exist in formal industries (e.g. oil & gas, public sector) and have staged strikes for better conditions, but **union busting** tactics sometimes occur and informal workers rarely have collective bargaining power. 

- **Regulatory Gaps & Enforcement:** The government struggles to enforce labor laws due to **insufficient labor inspectors** (Nigeria had roughly 1 inspector per 100,000 workers, far below ILO recommendation) ([Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Nigeria | U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/nigeria#:~:text=children%20at%20risk%20of%20child,active%20during%20the%20reporting%20period)). Child labor laws have loopholes – for example, they **do not cover self-employed children or those in informal work** ([Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Nigeria | U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/nigeria#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20Nigeria%20made%20minimal,cover%20the%20labor%20force%20and)), and one state (Kano) bizarrely does not prohibit using children in illicit activities ([Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Nigeria | U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/nigeria#:~:text=Organization%27s%20Accelerating%20Action%20for%20the,active%20during%20the%20reporting%20period)). Prosecution of labor traffickers is limited; convictions under the anti-trafficking agency (NAPTIP) are relatively few given the scale of the problem. This weak enforcement means many companies might unwittingly have labor abuses deep in their supply chain (e.g. a sub-supplier using child labor). 

**High-Risk Industries/Regions:** **Agriculture** (particularly cocoa in the south-west, and subsistence farming in the north) employs many children as field hands. **Mining and quarrying** in states like Zamfara, Niger, and Ogun are notorious – child labor in gold mining caused lead poisoning outbreaks in NW Nigeria, and in Ogun’s quarries children smash rocks for gravel ([Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Nigeria | U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/nigeria#:~:text=Image%3A%20Gold)) ([Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Nigeria | U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/nigeria#:~:text=Image%3A%20Forced%20Labor%20Icon)). The **textile/garment sector** in Lagos and Kano may use sweatshop labor including underage workers. **Domestic work** across urban areas often involves trafficked girls from rural villages. Regionally, **poverty in the north** (especially the North-West and North-East) correlates with higher child labor and forced begging (e.g. the almajiri system of Quranic schools has at times resulted in forced street begging by children). The conflict-ridden North-East has many **children out of school and vulnerable to exploitation**. The oil-producing Niger Delta, while richer, has **labor issues in artisanal refining** and a legacy of communities that feel exploited by oil companies without fair jobs or development – sometimes leading to local protests and unrest that companies must carefully navigate.

Given these factors, Nigeria’s labor practices risk is rated **8/10**. Companies sourcing from Nigeria must implement stringent labor due diligence: mapping supply chains down to raw material levels, requiring independent labor audits of suppliers, and engaging NGOs or initiatives (like ILO-IPEC programs) to address root causes. The **Nigerian government’s efforts** (e.g. a National Action Plan on child labor, and participation in the Alliance 8.7 to end child labor) are on-going but progress is slow ([Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Nigeria | U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/nigeria#:~:text=Minimal%20Advancement)). Until stronger enforcement takes hold, businesses should assume that **child and forced labor may be present in many sectors** and take proactive measures accordingly. 

## 4. Political Stability & Governance  

Nigeria’s political environment is characterized by a mix of democratic institutions and persistent **governance challenges**. While the country has enjoyed uninterrupted civilian rule since 1999 (eight election cycles), issues such as **electoral irregularities, policy instability, corruption, and regional tensions** undermine full political stability. For businesses, these translate into risks like sudden regulatory changes, inconsistent policy enforcement, and potential civil unrest. We assess Nigeria’s political stability and governance risk as **Significant (Score: 7/10)** – not a failed state, but volatile enough that companies must stay vigilant.

- **Electoral Integrity:** Nigeria’s elections, though competitive, are often marred by **violence and fraud allegations**. The most recent **February 2023 general election** saw a relatively peaceful transfer of power to President Bola Tinubu, but also reported problems. Independent observers noted **voter intimidation, vote-buying, and technical glitches** in transmitting results. Over **134 attacks on election commission offices** occurred during the election period ([Geopolitical Risk in Nigeria: A Comprehensive Analysis](https://infortal.com/solutions/global-risk-intelligence/geopolitical-risk/country-risk/nigeria-country-report/#:~:text=Abubakar)). Major opposition parties challenged the presidential results in court (alleging irregularities), though the Supreme Court ultimately upheld Tinubu’s victory. Historically, Nigerian elections (e.g. 2007, 2011) have experienced significant fraud and local violence. **Low voter turnout** – only ~29% in 2019 and 2023 – also reflects public distrust in the process. The **regional voting patterns** are sharp: e.g. in 2023, the new Labour Party swept the Christian Igbo-dominated South East, while Tinubu’s APC dominated the Muslim North West and Yoruba South West ([Geopolitical Risk in Nigeria: A Comprehensive Analysis](https://infortal.com/solutions/global-risk-intelligence/geopolitical-risk/country-risk/nigeria-country-report/#:~:text=On%20February%2025%2C%202023%2C%20Nigeria,Peter%20Obi%20and%20Atiku%20Abubakar)). These divisions can stoke post-election tensions. However, it’s notable that since 2015 Nigeria has had incumbent parties lose and hand over power (a sign of democratic resilience), and **transitions have remained peaceful** in terms of no coups ([Geopolitical Risk in Nigeria: A Comprehensive Analysis](https://infortal.com/solutions/global-risk-intelligence/geopolitical-risk/country-risk/nigeria-country-report/#:~:text=irregularities%2C%20and%20voter%20suppression%20continue,in%20control%20of%20the%20government)). The risk lies more in localized unrest (as seen in 2011 when post-election riots in the north killed 800+) and in the **legitimacy deficit** if citizens feel elections aren’t fully fair. For companies, electoral periods might mean disruptions (due to curfews or protests) and a watchful eye on any policy shifts by incoming administrations.

- **Government Effectiveness & Policy Stability:** Governance in Nigeria is often inconsistent. On one hand, institutions like the **central bank or finance ministry have some capacity**, and the bureaucracy can implement complex projects (e.g. ongoing infrastructure builds). On the other hand, **policy continuity is not guaranteed**. Changes in government frequently lead to reversals or delays: for example, the sudden **removal of fuel subsidies in 2023** by the new president – while economically justified – caused immediate price shocks and nationwide strikes. Subsequently, a partial return of subsidies occurred due to public pressure ([Allianz | Country Risk Report Nigeria](https://www.allianz.com/en/economic_research/country-and-sector-risk/country-risk/nigeria.html#:~:text=The%20government%20faces%20wide,less%20of%20a%20challenge%20with)) ([Allianz | Country Risk Report Nigeria](https://www.allianz.com/en/economic_research/country-and-sector-risk/country-risk/nigeria.html#:~:text=subsidies,but%20Nigeria%20requires%20an%20increase)), illustrating back-and-forth policymaking. Another example is foreign exchange policy: Nigeria long maintained multiple exchange rates; in June 2023 the central bank **floated the naira and unified rates** (a drastic shift) ([Nigeria Exchange Rate June 2023 - FocusEconomics](https://www.focus-economics.com/countries/nigeria/news/exchange-rate/central-bank-sets-the-naira-free-to-fall/#:~:text=On%2014%20June%2C%20the%20Nigerian,in%20the%20FX%20market%20had)) ([Nigeria Exchange Rate June 2023 - FocusEconomics](https://www.focus-economics.com/countries/nigeria/news/exchange-rate/central-bank-sets-the-naira-free-to-fall/#:~:text=USD%2C%20Refinitiv%20data%20showed,window%20exchange%20rate%20regime)). Businesses faced rapid adjustments as the currency lost ~40% value overnight. Regulatory agencies can also be unpredictable – for instance, sudden bans on certain imports or Twitter’s ban in 2021 (a regulatory action with political overtones). **Government effectiveness is hampered by corruption, patronage, and a bloated civil service.** The World Bank’s Governance Indicators consistently rank Nigeria low on control of corruption and government effectiveness (bottom quartile globally). However, federal structure allows some **state-level innovation** – e.g. Kaduna state’s public service reforms or Edo’s attempts to digitize governance – which means the operating environment can differ by state. Companies often report that navigating Nigerian bureaucracy requires local knowledge and constant engagement to handle shifting rules or requests.

- **Regional Tensions and Separatism:** Nigeria is a **federation of 36 states** with over 250 ethnic groups and a roughly equal Muslim-Christian split ([Geopolitical Risk in Nigeria: A Comprehensive Analysis](https://infortal.com/solutions/global-risk-intelligence/geopolitical-risk/country-risk/nigeria-country-report/#:~:text=is%20home%20to%20more%20than,small%20minority%20of%20other%20religions)) ([Geopolitical Risk in Nigeria: A Comprehensive Analysis](https://infortal.com/solutions/global-risk-intelligence/geopolitical-risk/country-risk/nigeria-country-report/#:~:text=Northern%20areas%2C%20which%20added%20to,faced%20since%20the%201999%20constitution)). Balancing these diverse interests is a core governance challenge. There are latent separatist sentiments – notably the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in the South-East advocate for secession of the former Biafra region. In the past few years, IPOB-related unrest (including the government’s designation of IPOB as a terrorist group and a military crackdown) has led to violence and **periodic “sit-at-home” strikes** that shut down businesses in the South-East. In the oil-rich Niger Delta (South-South), militant groups in the 2000s attacked oil facilities seeking greater resource control; a 2009 amnesty calmed the insurgency, but **militant agitation could resurface if grievances (pollution, under-development) aren’t addressed**. In the North, there’s resentment over poverty and feelings of marginalization by southern elites, while southern Nigerians often accuse northern politicians of oligarchic control. The government tries to maintain stability via power-sharing norms (the presidency tends to rotate between north and south, cabinet posts are geographically spread). Still, **communal violence can flare** – for example, long-running **herder-farmer conflicts** in the Middle-Belt have both ethnic and governance dimensions (state governments passing anti-open grazing laws vs. federal reluctance, etc.). These tensions don’t usually threaten the existence of the state, but they **impact security and policy** (e.g. federal vs state clashes over security jurisdiction, as seen when some states created armed vigilante outfits due to perceived federal inaction).

- **Institutional Checks and Balances:** Nigeria’s formal governance framework provides for separation of powers, but in practice the **executive dominates**. The presidency wields enormous influence (a “strong-man” political culture). The National Assembly has asserted itself occasionally (e.g. rejecting a third term bid by President Obasanjo in 2006 ([BTI 2024 Nigeria Country Report: BTI 2024](https://bti-project.org/en/reports/country-report/NGA#:~:text=The%20Fourth%20Republic%20Assembly%20is,and%20confirmation%20by%20the%20Senate))), but often the ruling party majority aligns with the president. The judiciary at the federal level has shown independence in some judgments, yet as noted earlier, is subject to political pressure at times. At state level, **governors can be very powerful** (often called “quasi-godfathers” in their states), sometimes overriding local legislatures and judiciaries ([BTI 2024 Nigeria Country Report: BTI 2024](https://bti-project.org/en/reports/country-report/NGA#:~:text=suspended%20on%20corruption%20charges,renumerated%20in%20the%20world)). Decentralization is incomplete – local governments rely on state allocations, and calls for restructuring (more autonomy to states) are a political hot potato. For businesses, this can mean **double exposure**: dealing with federal regulations and also unofficial expectations from state power-brokers. For instance, a company might obtain a federal permit for a project, but still need to satisfy state or local interests to proceed smoothly.

**Governance-Related Business Risks:** Despite these challenges, Nigeria remains Africa’s largest economy and a key market – many companies succeed by adapting to the governance landscape. However, risks include: **contract uncertainty** (a change of government might honor or cancel predecessors’ contracts – seen in the energy sector with power purchase agreements renegotiated), **legal system delays** (commercial disputes can drag on due to court inefficiency or corruption), and **compliance risks** (e.g. dealing with officials could expose companies to bribery solicitations, tying back to corruption risk). Policy instability – such as sudden forex restrictions, import bans (e.g. a ban on certain food imports to boost local agriculture), or shifts in taxation – can affect supply chain costs and planning. Furthermore, **civil unrest episodes** (protests against government policies like fuel price hikes, or ethnic riots) occasionally erupt and can disrupt operations or endanger personnel.

Given Nigeria’s relatively robust institutions on paper but inconsistent performance in practice, we rate political stability/governance risk 7/10. There is no imminent risk of state collapse or coup (the military has remained in barracks since 1999, unlike several neighboring countries recently), which keeps the score from being higher. But companies should prepare for a **volatile policy environment and localized instability**. Mitigation strategies include active government relations to anticipate policy moves, scenario planning around elections (e.g. stockpiling critical inputs in case of post-election unrest or currency swings), and investing in community development to build goodwill that can buffer against political shifts.

## 5. Security Threats  

**Risk Score: 9/10 (High).** Nigeria faces a complex and often dangerous security environment that significantly elevates operational risk. Companies must contend with threats ranging from terrorism and insurgency to armed banditry, kidnapping, and organized crime. The **geographical spread of insecurity** is broad – different regions experience distinct threats, meaning virtually all parts of Nigeria have some security concerns. The capacity of security forces, while improving in some respects, is **strained by multiple conflicts**, and law enforcement effectiveness is inconsistent. Key security issues include:

- **Terrorism & Insurgency:** For over a decade, Nigeria has battled the Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East. Though weakened, Boko Haram and its offshoot **Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP)** continue to stage attacks on both military and civilians. The conflict has killed tens of thousands and displaced over 2 million people in the North-East. In **2021 alone, violence (much of it from the insurgency) led to nearly 10,000 fatalities – a 30% increase from 2020 ([BTI 2024 Nigeria Country Report: BTI 2024](https://bti-project.org/en/reports/country-report/NGA#:~:text=The%20Nigerian%20army%20conducts%20military,rise%2C%20particularly%20in%20the%20South))**, according to ACLED data. Boko Haram/ISWAP tactics include suicide bombings, village raids, mass abductions (notoriously the **Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping in 2014**, and many similar school kidnappings since). Nigeria consistently ranks among the **world’s most terrorism-affected countries** (8th highest impact in 2024 Global Terrorism Index) ([Institute for Economics & Peace | Experts in Peace, Conflict and Risk](https://www.economicsandpeace.org/#:~:text=)) ([Nigeria Terrorism Index - Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/nigeria/terrorism-index#:~:text=Nigeria%20Terrorism%20Index%20,data%2C%20forecasts%20and%20news)). The insurgents also directly disrupt economic activity – for example, Borno state’s agriculture and trade have been devastated, and aid workers have been attacked. While Boko Haram is localized to the North-East, its ripple effects (refugee flows, military resource diversion) affect Nigeria’s overall stability.

- **Banditry & Mass Kidnapping:** In the North-West and parts of North-Central Nigeria, loosely organized armed “bandit” groups have proliferated in recent years. These groups engage in **mass kidnappings for ransom, rural killings, and raiding of communities**. The **kidnapping epidemic** is one of Nigeria’s gravest current threats: between mid-2022 and mid-2023, roughly **3,500 people were abducted in 582 incidents across the country** ([Nigeria's Kidnapping Crisis Highlights the Country's Problematic ...](https://inkstickmedia.com/nigerias-kidnapping-crisis-highlights-the-countrys-problematic-intelligence-infrastructure/#:~:text=Nigeria%27s%20Kidnapping%20Crisis%20Highlights%20the,a%20report%20by%20the)). Schools have been targeted – in 2021, over **780 students were kidnapped from schools** by armed groups ([Girls suffer most as Nigeria kidnap scourge hits school attendance | Context](https://www.context.news/socioeconomic-inclusion/girls-suffer-most-as-nigeria-kidnap-scourge-hits-school-attendance#:~:text=1%2C500)), forcing more than 700 schools to close out of fear ([Girls suffer most as Nigeria kidnap scourge hits school attendance | Context](https://www.context.news/socioeconomic-inclusion/girls-suffer-most-as-nigeria-kidnap-scourge-hits-school-attendance#:~:text=1%2C500)). This crisis has severely impacted education in the North. Bandits operating in states like Zamfara, Kaduna, Niger, and Katsina have at times overrun unpoliced rural areas, taxing local populations. Businesses face kidnapping risks not just in the north – highway abductions occur even in the south. Expatriate workers and wealthy Nigerians have been frequent targets of urban kidnapping gangs. For companies, this means **costs of stringent security protocols** (armed convoys, avoiding road travel at night, possibly using charter flights for intra-country movements). The kidnap for ransom industry is unfortunately booming – criminals often get paid, incentivizing more crime. According to Nigeria’s Security Tracker data, **19,366 Nigerians were kidnapped in 2,694 incidents over the last decade** ([The cost of getting kidnapped in Nigeria | The ICIR](https://www.icirnigeria.org/the-cost-of-getting-kidnapped-in-nigeria/#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20getting%20kidnapped,ten%20years%20as%20of)). The threat of kidnapping is a daily reality in parts of Nigeria and a top concern for investor safety.

- **Communal Violence:** Beyond organized groups, Nigeria sees frequent **inter-communal conflicts** that can be deadly. A major flashpoint is the **farmer-herder conflict** predominantly in the Middle Belt (states like Benue, Plateau, Kaduna) but spreading south. Clashes between predominantly Muslim Fulani herders and predominantly Christian farming communities over land use have killed thousands in the past few years. These incidents often have ethnic and religious undertones and can spiral into wider violence. In 2022, such communal conflicts remained intense, contributing to Nigeria’s overall violence tally. Additionally, ethnic clashes in cities (e.g. Yoruba vs Hausa skirmishes in Lagos or Ibadan) occasionally flare up. The Niger Delta, while quieter since the 2009 amnesty, still experiences episodic violence – local militias or criminal gangs sometimes rupture pipelines or engage in turf wars (as seen in the 2016 resurgence of the “Niger Delta Avengers” militancy). In the South-East, the confrontation between IPOB militants (or unknown gunmen) and security forces has led to assassinations of officials and days of economic shutdown due to IPOB’s enforced stay-at-home orders. Each region’s violence can disrupt supply chains: for instance, trucking routes through Kaduna or Niger State (which connect the north and south) have been subject to bandit attacks, affecting logistics. The **Abuja-Kaduna highway** infamously became a danger zone for kidnappings, and even the Abuja–Kaduna rail was attacked in 2022 with dozens taken hostage.

- **Crime and Urban Security:** Nigeria’s major cities (Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Kano, etc.) experience high levels of crime. Armed robbery, carjacking, burglary, and assaults are common concerns. Lagos, as a mega-city of ~20 million, has areas with significant criminal gang activity (so-called “area boys”). Violent crime in cities is fueled by economic hardship. There is also **maritime security risk in the Gulf of Guinea** – Nigerian waters have been a global hotspot for piracy targeting vessels (though incidents declined after 2021 due to enhanced naval patrols). Cybercrime (the notorious “Nigerian scam” networks) is more a reputational issue but highlights the presence of organized criminal enterprises. **Police effectiveness is limited**; response times can be slow and investigation success rates low, partly due to underfunding and corruption. Consequently, many businesses rely on private security. 

- **Security Infrastructure:** Nigeria has a large military and police force on paper (the Nigerian Police Force has over 350,000 personnel authorized, though fewer are operational). However, they are stretched thin by multiple internal operations. The military is deployed in over two dozen states for internal security duties – essentially acting in policing roles in conflict areas. This has somewhat **militarized the security landscape**, sometimes at the cost of community trust. Law enforcement suffers from poor training, inadequate equipment, and low morale. Nevertheless, the government has invested in security recently: purchasing Super Tucano aircraft for the Air Force to fight Boko Haram, and expanding local vigilante collaboration (e.g. the civilian Joint Task Force in Borno, or Amotekun in southwestern states for community policing). Private security companies also fill gaps, especially for protecting company facilities and ex-pat housing. For example, oil companies in the Niger Delta maintain their own well-armed security arrangements (often in coordination with Navy and Mobile Police units). **Intelligence and early warning** remain weak – attacks often take authorities by surprise, as seen in the brazen jailbreaks and the attack on a train in 2022. Crime prevention is hampered by the trust deficit between communities and security forces.

The overall security risk in Nigeria is **one of the highest globally**, reflected in global indices and the need for elevated risk management. In 2022, a Nigerian think-tank tallied **9,076 violent deaths and 4,680 abductions nationwide for the year ([Fewer Killings, Abductions In Nigeria In 2022 Compared To ...](https://humanglemedia.com/fewer-killings-abductions-in-nigeria-in-2022-compared-to-previous-year-but/#:~:text=Fewer%20Killings%2C%20Abductions%20In%20Nigeria,people%20were%20victims%20of%20abduction)) ([Fewer Killings, Abductions In Nigeria In 2022 Compared To ...](https://humanglemedia.com/fewer-killings-abductions-in-nigeria-in-2022-compared-to-previous-year-but/#:~:text=,people%20were%20victims%20of%20abduction))**, underscoring the scale of the threat. For LKSG compliance, companies must not only protect their operations but also ensure they are not inadvertently contributing to these security problems (for example, by paying off armed groups for access, which could violate sanctions or anti-terror laws). Due diligence might entail vetting security providers for human rights compliance, and community engagement to reduce conflict around business sites. Contingency plans (evacuation, ransom response, etc.) are unfortunately a necessity in Nigeria.

In summary, we assign **9/10** for security threat risk. The persistent terrorism in the north-east, expanding banditry in the north-west, and countrywide kidnapping and criminal risks create a very challenging environment. Improvement in one area (e.g. piracy down in the Delta) is offset by deterioration in others. Companies should monitor security developments continuously, work with security experts, and integrate security risk assessments into all business decisions in Nigeria.

## 6. Environmental Risks  

**Risk Score: 7/10 (Significant).** Nigeria’s environmental risk profile is high, with direct implications for supply chains and regulatory compliance under LKSG (which covers environmental due diligence). The country faces **serious environmental challenges** ranging from climate change impacts (extreme weather, rising temperatures) to severe local pollution (oil spills, gas flaring, and urban waste). Environmental governance exists (laws and agencies like NESREA), but enforcement is often lax due to corruption and capacity gaps. Key environmental risk factors:

- **Climate Change Vulnerabilities:** Nigeria is **highly vulnerable to climate change**. It spans diverse ecological zones – arid Sahel in the far north, savannah in middle, tropical delta in the south – all of which are experiencing climate stress. In the north, **desertification is advancing**; the Sahara’s southward creep and recurrent droughts are degrading farmland and pasture. This has exacerbated the farmer-herder conflict as grazing lands shrink. In the south, **rainfall patterns are shifting**, and intense rainy-season floods have become more frequent. Notably, in **2022 Nigeria suffered its worst flooding in decades** – 34 of 36 states were affected, **over 1.4 million people displaced and more than 600 killed** ([2022 Nigeria floods - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Nigeria_floods#:~:text=From%20the%20Federal%20Government%20Data%2C,About%2082%2C035)). These floods submerged farms (raising food security issues), washed out roads, and interrupted business operations extensively. Climate models project increased rainfall variability and sea level rise that could threaten coastal mega-cities like Lagos (which already battles regular flooding from heavy rains and poor drainage). Nigeria’s large population and infrastructure deficits amplify the impact of climate events – e.g. a flood easily turns into a humanitarian disaster given limited drainage and emergency services. The Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index ranks Nigeria low in readiness to cope with climate change. For companies, climate risks mean potential **supply disruptions (flooded transport routes, damaged facilities)** and long-term challenges such as water scarcity in manufacturing or agriculture. 

- **Deforestation and Resource Depletion:** According to the UN, Nigeria has **the world’s highest deforestation rate**, losing **around 3.5–4% of forest cover per year** ([Nigeria: Climate Change Country Profile (November 2023)](https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/nigeria-climate-change-country-profile-november-2023#:~:text=Nigeria%3A%20Climate%20Change%20Country%20Profile,It%20is)). Population pressure and reliance on wood fuel drive forest loss. Between 2001 and 2022, Nigeria lost about 12% of its tree cover ([Poverty-fueled deforestation of Nigerian reserve slashes hope for ...](https://news.mongabay.com/2023/07/poverty-fueled-deforestation-of-nigerian-reserve-slashes-hope-for-rare-chimps/#:~:text=Poverty,)). This deforestation leads to soil erosion, biodiversity loss (Nigeria’s unique species like the Cross River gorilla are endangered), and contributes to desertification in the north. Fisheries and wildlife are under stress; Lake Chad, once a vital water source for the NE, has dramatically shrunk (though partially due to upstream water management and climate). **Resource depletion** extends to minerals – illegal or unregulated mining (for gold, columbite, etc.) not only causes environmental damage (toxic run-off, landscape scarring) but also deprives communities of sustainable land use. Nigeria’s oil resources are also being extracted with insufficient regard for the environment historically (discussed below). Water resources: Nigeria experiences seasonal water shortages in the north, and pollution of rivers in the south. The Niger River and others are polluted by sewage and chemicals. 

- **Oil Pollution in the Niger Delta:** One of the most notorious environmental issues is the **oil pollution in the Niger Delta region**. Decades of oil extraction have resulted in **thousands of oil spills**. Pipelines (many aging) and wellheads have leaked, and oil theft/sabotage also cause spills and pipeline explosions. Companies like Shell and Eni reported hundreds of spills annually; in 2021 Shell alone recorded **106 spills totaling 3,300 tonnes of crude** released (double the volume of 2020) ([Shell 2021 oil spills in Nigeria double in volume | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shell-2021-oil-spills-nigeria-double-volume-2022-04-05/#:~:text=LONDON%2C%20April%205%20%28Reuters%29%20,level%20last%20seen%20in%202016)). These spills have devastated mangrove forests and fisheries. For example, the Bodo community spill in 2008 coated rivers with thick oil, ruining livelihoods (Shell settled with the community for \$83 million in compensation after legal action in the UK). As of 2023, cleanup of contaminated sites has been very slow – the UNEP-estimated 30-year cleanup in Ogoniland has barely started (only ~11% of planned sites have seen work) ([No clean up, no justice: Shell's oil pollution in the Niger Delta](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/06/no-clean-up-no-justice-shell-oil-pollution-in-the-niger-delta/#:~:text=Delta%20www,of%20planned%20sites)). For residents, this is an everyday human and environmental tragedy: farmland poisoned, water unsafe, health issues like skin lesions and respiratory problems from hydrocarbon exposure. Gas flaring (burning off gas at oil wells) is another serious pollutant in the Delta: Nigeria flares the **second most gas in the world after Russia** ([Niger River Delta by Night](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/83306/niger-river-delta-by-night#:~:text=dim%20compared%20to%20the%20flares,generation%20rates%20in%20the%20world)) ([Niger River Delta by Night](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/83306/niger-river-delta-by-night#:~:text=About%2010%20percent%20of%20the,government%20has%20sought%20to%20limit)), causing acid rain and emitting soot. At night, **gas flares in the Delta are so numerous that they outshine city lights on satellite images** ([Niger River Delta by Night](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/83306/niger-river-delta-by-night#:~:text=At%20night%2C%20gas%20flares%20outshine,generation%20rates%20in%20the%20world)). 

 ([Niger River Delta by Night](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/83306/niger-river-delta-by-night)) *Gas flares light up the Niger Delta night sky (bright spots), far outshining nearby city lights. Nigeria has more gas flares than almost any country, reflecting the oil industry’s environmental toll ([Niger River Delta by Night](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/83306/niger-river-delta-by-night#:~:text=dim%20compared%20to%20the%20flares,generation%20rates%20in%20the%20world)) ([Niger River Delta by Night](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/83306/niger-river-delta-by-night#:~:text=About%2010%20percent%20of%20the,government%20has%20sought%20to%20limit)).* 

The government has set 2030 as a target to end routine flaring, and recently there are efforts to commercialize captured gas, but progress is halting ([Nigeria's pioneering gas flaring plan risks going down in flames | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/nigerias-pioneering-gas-flaring-plan-risks-going-down-in-flames-idUSKBN26L1AU/#:~:text=Reuters%20could%20not%20establish%20if,human%20health%20and%20the%20environment)) ([Nigeria's pioneering gas flaring plan risks going down in flames | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/nigerias-pioneering-gas-flaring-plan-risks-going-down-in-flames-idUSKBN26L1AU/#:~:text=After%20sunset%2C%20nearly%20200%20blinking,or%20for%20plastics%20or%20fertilizers)). For supply chain due diligence, any company connected to petroleum (directly or via fuels, plastics sourcing) must be aware of the **environmental damage and community grievances in the Delta**, as well as the legal liabilities – oil majors operating in Nigeria have faced lawsuits in foreign courts for environmental harm.

- **Urban Pollution and Waste:** Nigeria’s booming cities struggle with **waste management and pollution**. Lagos generates huge volumes of solid waste, much of which ends up in informal dumps or clogging drainage channels (worsening flooding). Open burning of waste is common, releasing toxins. **Air pollution** in cities is severe – Lagos and Port Harcourt experience heavy smog partly from traffic (Nigeria has many old, high-emission vehicles) and generators (due to power outages, millions of small diesel generators run daily). In Port Harcourt, mysterious black soot blanketed the city in 2016–2017, linked to illegal refining of stolen crude (“kpofire”) and flares. Indoor air pollution from cooking with wood or kerosene is also a major health issue in rural areas. Water pollution in urban areas is widespread as well – many factories dump effluents into rivers with little oversight, and only ~10% of Nigerians have access to piped safe water; others rely on wells that could be contaminated. The country also has become an endpoint for e-waste and other hazardous waste, adding to environmental health risks.

- **Regulatory Enforcement:** Nigeria has environmental regulations (e.g. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) requirements for projects, emission standards, etc.) and is party to international agreements (Paris Climate Accord, etc.). However, enforcement is sporadic. **Corruption and weak governance hamper regulators**. For instance, despite laws against gas flaring with fines, oil companies often chose to pay minimal fines rather than invest in capture, as enforcement was lax. Similarly, illegal refineries operate in the creeks with impunity until a major accident occurs. The National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) does monitor spills and has fined firms (Shell was fined \$2 billion by a Nigerian court for an alleged spill ([Shell 2021 oil spills in Nigeria double in volume | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shell-2021-oil-spills-nigeria-double-volume-2022-04-05/#:~:text=which%20has%20struggled%20for%20years,operational%20incidents%2C%20theft%20and%20sabotage))), but collection of fines or actual remediation is another matter. On the climate front, Nigeria has released plans for emissions reduction and even has a Climate Change Act (2021) that establishes a Council to coordinate climate policy – a positive step, but implementation will tell. Meanwhile, **deforestation continues largely unchecked**; efforts like the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) are in infancy. 

**Impact on Business:** Environmental degradation can directly disrupt operations (as seen when severe floods in 2022 submerged major highways and halted logistics for weeks). It also poses **reputational risks** – companies linked to ecological damage (oil, mining, agriculture that drives deforestation) could face legal action or consumer backlash, especially under Germany’s LKSG which emphasizes environmental due diligence. Supply chains could be affected by resource scarcity (e.g. water shortages for beverage manufacturers during droughts, or reduced crop yields for commodity buyers due to climate events). Additionally, **compliance with evolving Nigerian environmental laws** and international standards is crucial – for example, new Methane Guidelines for oil/gas were issued in 2023 ([Nigeria - Policies & action | Climate Action Tracker](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/nigeria/policies-action/#:~:text=Nigeria%20,measures%20such%20as%20leak)), and more stringent waste regulations could emerge as Nigeria tries to manage its pollution crises.

We rate environmental risk 7/10. It is high and damaging, but not a complete 9 or 10 because some mitigating factors exist: Nigeria is investing in adaptation (e.g. constructing drainage, signing onto climate finance), and the worst impacts like desertification are somewhat localized. Nonetheless, for any responsible company, Nigeria’s environmental situation demands strong action: conducting EIAs for projects, community engagement on environmental issues, emergency preparedness for disasters (flood, spill), and striving for environmental best practices beyond what local law requires (since enforcement is weak). 

## 7. Economic Stability  

**Risk Score: 6/10 (Moderate).** Nigeria’s economy is a mix of great potential and chronic instability. As Africa’s largest economy (GDP ~$477 billion in 2022), it offers a large market and abundant resources, but macroeconomic volatility and structural challenges pose risks to businesses. Currency fluctuations, high inflation, heavy dependence on oil, and infrastructure gaps are key issues. While not in economic freefall, Nigeria’s economy can be unpredictable – hence a moderate risk rating, tilted toward caution.

- **Currency Volatility & Forex Restrictions:** The Nigerian **naira (₦) is volatile and tightly managed by the central bank**. For years, the central bank operated multiple exchange rates (a subsidized official rate and a parallel market rate), leading to distortions. In June 2023, the new administration moved to **unify exchange rates and float the naira**, causing an abrupt **devaluation of about 40%** (from ₦463/$ to ₦750/$ in one day) ([Nigeria Exchange Rate June 2023 - FocusEconomics](https://www.focus-economics.com/countries/nigeria/news/exchange-rate/central-bank-sets-the-naira-free-to-fall/#:~:text=On%2014%20June%2C%20the%20Nigerian,in%20the%20FX%20market%20had)) ([Nigeria Exchange Rate June 2023 - FocusEconomics](https://www.focus-economics.com/countries/nigeria/news/exchange-rate/central-bank-sets-the-naira-free-to-fall/#:~:text=USD%2C%20Refinitiv%20data%20showed,window%20exchange%20rate%20regime)). Such swings are challenging for businesses – import costs soared and any company holding naira saw instant devaluation. The naira continues to fluctuate; by the end of 2023 it traded around ₦900–950 per USD on official markets and even weaker in parallel. In 2024, further depreciation occurred (₦1,535/$ by end of 2024, a 40% drop from end-2023) ([Naira Falls 40.9% in 2024, Closing at N1,535/$1 - MSME Africa](https://msmeafricaonline.com/naira-falls-40-9-in-2024-closing-at-n1535-1/#:~:text=Naira%20Falls%2040.9,at%20the%20end%20of%202023)). Additionally, the central bank historically imposed **Forex restrictions** on certain imports (e.g. a list of 41 items barred from accessing official FX) to protect reserves. Capital controls have also been an issue – foreign investors at times struggled to repatriate profits due to dollar shortages. Notably, by late 2022, foreign airlines had **over \$460 million in ticket sales trapped in Nigeria** because the central bank could not allocate them foreign currency ([FOREIGN AIRLINES AND TRAPPED FUNDS - THISDAYLIVE](https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2024/01/19/foreign-airlines-and-trapped-funds/#:~:text=FOREIGN%20AIRLINES%20AND%20TRAPPED%20FUNDS,it%20hovers%20around%20%24800%20million)), leading some airlines to cut flights. Though the government cleared much of these by 2023, the episode hurt investor confidence. Businesses in Nigeria often resort to the black market for dollars at higher rates, or maintain offshore accounts to hedge. This currency risk means companies face **planning difficulties and potential losses** if the naira slides (which it often does when oil prices drop or policy shifts). On the upside, the unification of rates is a reform that could, in the long run, improve transparency and attract investors – but short-term pain is evident.

- **Inflation and Monetary Policy:** Nigeria has experienced **high inflation in recent years**, eroding purchasing power. In 2023, inflation accelerated sharply, hitting **an 18-year high of 25.8% in August 2023** ([Nigeria inflation rises to 18-year high in August ahead of rates decision | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-consumer-inflation-2580-yy-august-stats-office-2023-09-15/#:~:text=ABUJA%2C%20Sept%2015%20%28Reuters%29%20,rate%20decision%20later%20this%20month)) after fuel subsidy removal and the naira devaluation drove up prices. Food inflation is even higher (over 30% at times) as local food production can’t meet demand and imports became pricier. By December 2024, inflation climbed further to ~34% ([Nigeria Inflation Rate - Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/nigeria/inflation-cpi#:~:text=Nigeria%20Inflation%20Rate%20,in%20the%20prior%20month)), although a subsequent methodological change by the statistics agency moderated the reported rate to 24% in early 2025 ([Nigeria's inflation rate drops after statistics overhauled and updated](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-inflation-2448-yy-january-after-rebasing-2025-02-18/#:~:text=updated%20www,from%20the%20previous%20month%27s)). Regardless, businesses and workers have been coping with **double-digit inflation (often 15%+) for over six years** ([Nigeria Inflation Rate 1960-2025 | MacroTrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/nga/nigeria/inflation-rate-cpi#:~:text=,increase%20from%202019)). The Central Bank of Nigeria has raised interest rates (reaching about 18.5% in 2023) to curb inflation, but with limited effect given structural factors (import dependency, exchange rate pass-through, security-related food supply issues). For companies, inflation means **higher costs for inputs and wage pressure**, and it complicates long-term contracts (prices may need frequent renegotiation). It also contributes to consumer poverty – about 40% of Nigerians live below the poverty line – potentially dampening demand for non-essential goods. 

- **Oil Dependence and Fiscal Health:** Nigeria’s economy (and government revenues) are heavily reliant on crude oil exports (oil is ~90% of export earnings ([Allianz | Country Risk Report Nigeria](https://www.allianz.com/en/economic_research/country-and-sector-risk/country-risk/nigeria.html#:~:text=However%2C%20in%20an%20economic%20environment,assessed%20to%20be%20above%20USD150%2Fbarrel)) ([Allianz | Country Risk Report Nigeria](https://www.allianz.com/en/economic_research/country-and-sector-risk/country-risk/nigeria.html#:~:text=Nigeria%E2%80%99s%20heavily%20reliance%20on%20oil,is%20approximately%2080USD%2Fbarrel%2C%20while%20the))). This makes the country vulnerable to global oil price swings. A drop in oil prices (like in 2020) hits foreign reserves, causes government budget crises, and often leads to currency pressure. Even when oil prices are high, Nigeria has struggled to increase production due to oil theft and underinvestment; in 2022, output fell to multi-decade lows (~1.2 million barrels/day) as thieves tapped pipelines. This has kept government finances strained despite oil price recovery. The new government has taken bold fiscal steps, notably removing the **fuel subsidy in mid-2023** which was a huge drain (costing $10 billion in 2022). While economically sensible, this caused immediate hardship via tripled petrol prices. The government briefly reinstated some subsidies in 2024 as inflation spiked ([Allianz | Country Risk Report Nigeria](https://www.allianz.com/en/economic_research/country-and-sector-risk/country-risk/nigeria.html#:~:text=The%20government%20faces%20wide,untargeted%20oil%20subsidies%20are%20scheduled)). Nigeria’s **public debt is rising** (debt-to-GDP ~37% in 2023, up from ~20% in 2015) but still moderate; however, debt servicing consumes a very high share of government revenue (over 90% at times) due to low revenue collection. The fiscal deficit hovers ~5% of GDP ([Allianz | Country Risk Report Nigeria](https://www.allianz.com/en/economic_research/country-and-sector-risk/country-risk/nigeria.html#:~:text=Fiscal%20pressures%20persist%20due%20to,and%20increased%20liquidity%20support%20stability)). The risk is that if oil prices slump or if reforms falter, Nigeria could face a debt or balance-of-payments crisis. The government has sought World Bank/IMF support in the past for policy advice, but it avoids full IMF programs that would mandate strict austerity.

- **Banking System:** Nigeria’s banking sector underwent consolidation in the 2000s and cleaned up after a 2009 crisis. Major banks (e.g. Zenith, GTBank, Access) are relatively well-capitalized and regional in presence. However, banks are heavily exposed to government securities and oil sector loans. **Forex liquidity issues** have also affected banks – when dollars are scarce, banks limit availability to customers. In 2023, as the naira floated, some banks temporarily halted FX trading to adjust. The Central Bank has a history of unorthodox policies (e.g. in 2021 it banned cryptocurrency transactions by banks and lent directly to the government via Ways and Means beyond legal limits). A new CBN leadership in 2023 is attempting to restore credibility. Overall, while **bank failure risk is not especially high now**, confidence can be rattled by policy surprises. Companies should be mindful of counterparty risk with smaller or state-owned banks and the possibility of capital controls returning if reserves dip.

- **Infrastructure and Power:** A major economic constraint (and risk) is **Nigeria’s inadequate infrastructure**. Chronic power outages are perhaps the number one complaint of businesses – the national grid supplies only about **4,000 MW on average for a country of 200+ million** ([Addressing Nigeria’s Lingering Power Challenge](https://agorapolicy.org/research/policy-memo/89-addressing-nigerias-lingering-power-challenge.html#:~:text=stations%E2%80%94three%20hydro%20and%20six%20thermal,low%20and%20is%20three%20times)) ([Addressing Nigeria’s Lingering Power Challenge](https://agorapolicy.org/research/policy-memo/89-addressing-nigerias-lingering-power-challenge.html#:~:text=MW3%20,saharan%20Africa%2028)). This results in expensive self-generation (diesel generators are ubiquitous). The World Bank estimates power unreliability costs Nigeria ~$26 billion annually (2% of GDP) ([Addressing Nigeria’s Lingering Power Challenge](https://agorapolicy.org/research/policy-memo/89-addressing-nigerias-lingering-power-challenge.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20World%20Bank1,of%20Nigeria%E2%80%99s%20GDP)) ([Addressing Nigeria’s Lingering Power Challenge](https://agorapolicy.org/research/policy-memo/89-addressing-nigerias-lingering-power-challenge.html#:~:text=electricity%20access2,of%20Nigeria%E2%80%99s%20GDP)). Transport infrastructure is also lacking: ports (especially Apapa port in Lagos) are notoriously congested and inefficient, adding significant delays and costs to imports/exports. The road network has many bad segments – for example, the key Lagos-to-Kano trucking route has portions that are potholed or insecure. The rail network is limited, though new standard-gauge lines (Abuja–Kaduna, Lagos–Ibadan) have come online recently. Logistics difficulties can disrupt supply chains and increase costs. Internet and telecom infrastructure is relatively better (Nigeria has ~50% internet penetration, mostly mobile). The government is investing in infrastructure (with help from Chinese loans for rail and road projects), but progress is slow relative to need. For businesses, **infrastructure unreliability is a cost driver and a risk** (e.g. goods damaged in transit on bad roads, or production downtime due to power cuts).

- **Economic Outlook:** Nigeria’s growth has been sluggish in per capita terms. After a recession in 2020 (-1.8% GDP), growth was about 3.6% in 2021 and ~3.3% in 2022, driven by non-oil sectors (tech, agriculture) while oil lagged. The IMF projects around 3% growth for 2023–2024 ([Nigeria Overview: Development news, research, data - World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/nigeria/overview#:~:text=Bank%20www,conditions%20for%20stability%20and%20growth)), which, given population growth of ~2.5%, means minimal per capita income gains. **Unemployment remains very high** (estimated around 33% by Nigeria’s old methodology, though a rebase of figures is pending). Foreign direct investment has dropped in recent years, partly because investors are wary of forex issues and insecurity. If reforms (like FX liberalization and fiscal adjustments) are sustained, they could unleash more investment – but short term they have caused pain. Another factor: Nigeria’s economy is not very diversified – oil still dictates government spending ability, and manufacturing contributes only ~12% of GDP. The tech/startup sector has been a bright spot (Nigeria is a fintech leader in Africa), but regulatory and financing hurdles remain for scaling businesses.

Overall, Nigeria’s economic risk is **moderate to high**. We assign **6/10**, acknowledging serious issues but also noting that Nigeria has avoided total economic meltdown in recent times by taking some corrective actions. The LKSG requires assessing not just immediate economic metrics but also the stability of economic conditions that could affect human rights and environment in supply chains. For instance, high inflation and unemployment in Nigeria can indirectly drive more child labor or illegal mining (as families cope with hardship) – linking economic stability to social risks. Companies should plan for scenarios like sudden devaluation (hedging where possible), engage in policy advocacy through chambers of commerce for more predictable economic policies, and incorporate buffer in contracts (e.g. inflation indexing). Keeping finances flexible (able to operate with Naira and source hard currency creatively) is critical in Nigeria’s market. 

## 8. Health & Safety Environment  

**Risk Score: 7/10 (Significant).** Nigeria’s public health and occupational safety environment present considerable risks to workforce stability and business continuity. The country struggles with a high **disease burden**, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, and frequent safety incidents (both in and outside workplaces). These conditions can lead to increased absenteeism, lowered productivity, and even operational shutdowns in extreme cases (e.g. epidemics). Companies operating in Nigeria need to actively manage health & safety risks to ensure a stable workforce and compliance with due diligence standards.

- **Public Health Infrastructure:** Nigeria’s healthcare system is **under-resourced and overstretched**. The World Health Organization ranked Nigeria 187th of 191 countries for health system performance (UHC coverage) as of 2018 ([Healthcare in Nigeria - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Nigeria#:~:text=Healthcare%20delivery%20in%20Nigeria%20has,expenditure%20on%20health%20as%20a)). Government health expenditure is very low (usually 3–4% of GDP), resulting in hospitals that lack equipment, drugs, and staff. There is a significant urban-rural gap: cities have some decent private hospitals, whereas rural areas often have no doctors. A telling statistic – about **74% of total health spending is out-of-pocket by citizens** ([Healthcare in Nigeria - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Nigeria#:~:text=,85)), indicating many Nigerians must pay for care or go without. **Human capital flight** is a major issue: tens of thousands of Nigerian doctors and nurses have emigrated to the UK, US, Canada, etc. in recent years for better pay ([Healthcare in Nigeria - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Nigeria#:~:text=spent%20on%20procuring%20%27alternatives%27.%20Nigerian,4)), leaving shortages behind. This weak health infrastructure means Nigeria is **vulnerable to outbreaks**. Indeed, Nigeria has faced repeated epidemics: cholera outbreaks happen almost yearly (in 2021, over 3,600 died of cholera nationwide), Lassa fever (an endemic hemorrhagic fever) infects dozens annually, and of course COVID-19 hit in 2020. The **COVID-19 pandemic** was managed relatively well in terms of official death toll (~3,155 deaths reported), but low testing means the true impact could be higher. It did stress the system and led to lockdowns in 2020 that disrupted businesses. Nigeria also only recently (2020) was declared wild polio-free, yet vaccine-derived polio still circulates in some areas due to patchy immunization.

- **Disease Burden:** Malaria is hyper-endemic in Nigeria and remains the top killer of children. All employees in Nigeria are at risk of malaria; companies often need to provide mosquito nets, prophylaxis, and rapid treatment to workers to reduce downtime. HIV/AIDS prevalence is about 1.3% (2021) – lower than in Southern Africa, but Nigeria’s large population means over 1.9 million people live with HIV. Tuberculosis is also common (Nigeria is among high-TB burden countries). Non-communicable diseases like hypertension are rising with urbanization, but infectious diseases still dominate the health profile. High disease burden can lead to **absenteeism** and increased healthcare costs for employers who provide clinics or insurance. Furthermore, periodic outbreaks (like the 2014 Ebola importation, which Nigeria fortunately contained quickly) pose a risk of sudden crises.

- **Occupational Health & Safety:** Workplace safety standards in Nigeria are inconsistently enforced. The main law (Factories Act 1987) is outdated and covers mainly formal industrial workplaces, whereas a huge portion of labor happens informally (construction sites, small workshops, etc.) with virtually no oversight. As mentioned in the Labor section, industrial accidents are frequent. To add detail: a study in **Lagos and Ogun factories found regular incidents of amputations, burns, and deaths**, often because machines lack guards and workers lack training or protective gear ([With No Training, I Risked Fingers, Hearing to Make Plastic Bottles](https://fij.ng/article/special-report-i-risked-fingers-hearing-to-make-plastic-bottles-at-cascade-waters-for-n1500-pay/#:~:text=There%20are%20also%20those%20who,how%20such%20injuries%20could%20occur)) ([With No Training, I Risked Fingers, Hearing to Make Plastic Bottles](https://fij.ng/article/special-report-i-risked-fingers-hearing-to-make-plastic-bottles-at-cascade-waters-for-n1500-pay/#:~:text=In%20the%20last%2015%20years%2C,Henkel%20Industries%20in%20Oyo%20State)). Construction is another hazardous sector – building collapses in Lagos and other cities have killed workers and bystanders (in 2021, a high-rise under construction collapsed in Ikoyi, Lagos, killing 47). Fire safety is poor; markets and factories suffer devastating fires due to faulty electricals or fuel storage (for instance, a pipeline explosion in Lagos in 2020 killed 15 and destroyed a girls’ boarding school). **Mining** (especially informal mining) is extremely dangerous – beyond the child labor issue, even adult artisanal miners often lack any safety equipment, leading to frequent mine collapses and lead poisoning cases. Transportation for workers also has risks: road accidents are a leading cause of death in Nigeria (the country has one of the highest road fatality rates globally), so staff traveling by road for work face significant danger from accidents or highway crime. 

- **Emergency Response and Public Safety:** Nigeria’s emergency response infrastructure is limited. Ambulance services and 911-type systems exist only in a few cities in rudimentary form. In accidents or medical emergencies, response is often ad-hoc – private cars rushing victims to hospitals, etc. During large-scale emergencies (e.g. floods, mass casualty events), agencies like NEMA (National Emergency Management Agency) often lack resources, so response can be slow. This means companies should have their own emergency action plans, including first aid training for staff and perhaps retaining medical evacuation services for expats or critical cases. Public safety issues (crime, discussed in Security) also intersect – for example, if an employee is injured during an armed robbery, the ability to get timely medical care is uncertain.

- **Worker Well-being and Stability:** The combination of public health issues and safety risks can impact workforce stability. Frequent illness (malaria bouts, etc.) can reduce productivity. In some regions, employees may need time off during planting/harvest or local conflicts (affecting their families), so absenteeism isn’t solely health-related but often multi-factorial. Strikes in the health sector occur often – Nigerian doctors in public hospitals have gone on strike almost annually over pay and conditions (e.g. a long doctors’ strike in 2021). If a company’s health insurance relies on public hospitals, those strikes disrupt care. Mental health, often overlooked, is also a growing concern in a high-stress environment like Nigeria’s cities, though stigma remains high and few resources are available.

**Recent Developments:** There have been some improvements – Nigeria’s life expectancy, while still low, has inched up to ~55 years ([Healthcare in Nigeria - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Nigeria#:~:text=Healthcare%20delivery%20in%20Nigeria%20has,expenditure%20on%20health%20as%20a)) (from 46 in 2000). Immunization rates for childhood diseases have improved in the south (though northern rates lag). The government launched a Basic Health Care Provision Fund to improve primary care in 2018, and some states are rolling out health insurance schemes. Occupational safety is getting attention too: for instance, Lagos state in 2022 began closing down factories with egregious safety violations after some fatal accidents made news. Technology is being used for health (telemedicine startups, drone delivery of blood in remote areas via a company like Lifebank). These efforts could reduce risk over time, but for now the **health & safety environment remains challenging**.

Given all these factors, the risk to business is significant but can be mitigated with proactive measures. We assign **7/10**. To manage this risk, companies should invest in **employee health programs** (malaria prevention, health check-ups, good health insurance), ensure **strict safety protocols** in their operations (with training and protective equipment provided, even if not mandated by lax local enforcement), and consider **on-site clinics or retained medical services** especially if in remote locations. Preparedness for pandemics or local outbreaks (like having a plan for if Lassa fever hits a site) is part of LKSG-aligned due diligence. A healthier and safer workforce not only fulfills social responsibility but directly supports productivity and reliability in Nigerian operations.
