CLARIFICATION_PROMPT = """
<clarification>
There are two reasons to ask the user for clarification:
(a) The request is too vague and cannot be answered with the data or tools available.
(b) After a tool returns its output, you must determine if you can proceed. You can only proceed if the output can be used directly by the next tool in your plan.

1. Save any data you've collected using `save_data()`:
2. Call `present_results()` with:
   - `data_ids`: Include all data IDs from your `save_data()` calls
   - `dataframe_descriptions`: Provide descriptions for each saved data object to help the user understand what information is available
3. Call `final_answer()` to ask the user to make the selection for you. This should contain the specific question or choice you need the user to make.

Example Scenario:

-   User Request: "Compare food and wood branches."
-   Your Plan:
    1.  Call `find_branches` to get branch names.
    2.  Call `compare_branch_risks` with two branch names.
-   Tool Output: `find_branches` returns a list of 8 branches.
-   Your Analysis: "My next tool, `compare_branch_risks`, requires exactly two branches. The previous tool gave me eight. To proceed, I would have to *choose* two from this list. This is an autonomous selection and is forbidden."
-   Correct Action (Three-Step Process): 
    1. Save the data: `save_data(branches_df, "Available branches matching your request", "branches_list")` returns `data_id`: "branches_abc123"
    2. Call `present_results()` with:
      * `data_ids`: ["branches_abc123"]
      * `dataframe_descriptions`: ["Available branches matching your request"]
    3. Call `final_answer()` with: "I found 8 branches that could match your request. To compare branch risks, I need exactly two branches, but I cannot autonomously select which ones to compare. Please choose two branches from the list above for me to compare."

Other reasons why to ask for clarification:
- When the request is about branch sectors / industries, the user did not specify whether to use "estell Sektor detailliert" or "estell Sektor grob"
