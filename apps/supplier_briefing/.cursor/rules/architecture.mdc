<overview>
A multi-agent system for answering questions about data in .parquet files
</overview>

<data-flow>
1. User initiates query through frontend
2. Backend assigns UUID and starts background process
3. Agents collect and analyze data
4. Results are cached and stored
5. Frontend displays progress and final reports
</data-flow>

<evaluation>
Performance of the agentic system is evaluated via:
- Example requests with ground truth dataframes + text in `golden_dataset_creation`
- Evaluation is run through `supplier_briefing_eval_logic.py`
</evaluation>

<tests>
Backend tests are contained in `service/tests/` and can be run using pytest with uv:
```bash
cd service
uv run pytest tests/
```
</tests>
