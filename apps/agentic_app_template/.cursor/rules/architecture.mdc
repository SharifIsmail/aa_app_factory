## Overview
A multi-agent system for comprehensive supply chain due diligence and risk assessment, compliant with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LKSG - Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz).
## System Components

## Technical Requirements and Tech stack
- Python 3.12.8
- Node.js (for frontend)
- Static typing enforced by MyPY. Stick to static definitions on all generations!
- When frontend code always prioritize the Aleph Alpha (AA) UI components over custom component generation from scratch, unless there is no option.
- Available API keys:
    - check service/env.sample file 

### Frontend (@/ui)
- Vue.js application with TypeScript
- Components:
    - list components


### Backend (@service/src/service)
- FastAPI-based Python service
- Core components:
  - `main.py`: Application entry point
  - `routes.py`: API endpoints
  - `persistence_service.py`: Data storage and caching


### Agents (@src/assistant/supplier_analysis/service/src/service/lksg_core)
- `agent_extract_company_data/`: Company data collection
- Tools for data collection and analysis

## Data Flow
1. User initiates search through frontend
2. Backend assigns UUID and starts background process
3. Agents collect and analyze data
4. Results are cached and stored
5. Frontend displays progress and final reports

## Key Features
- Data caching and persistence
- Real-time progress tracking
- Comprehensive reporting
- Configurable data sources
