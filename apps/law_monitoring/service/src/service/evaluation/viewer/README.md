## Technology Stack

- **Vue 3** with Composition API
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and building

- **Vue Router** for navigation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.19.0 or higher
- Access to Pharia Studio with a valid bearer token

### Installation

1. Navigate to the viewer directory:
   ```bash
   cd service/src/service/evaluation/viewer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

### Configuration

1. **Get your Bearer Token**:
   - Log into Pharia Studio
   - Generate or copy your API bearer token

2. **Get Execution URLs**:
   - Navigate to a benchmark execution in Pharia Studio
   - Copy the full URL (should include `/executions/{id}`)

3. **Use the Application**:
   - Paste your bearer token in the configuration section
   - Paste execution URL(s) depending on whether you want single analysis or comparison
   - Click "Load Executions" or "Compare Executions"

## Usage Examples

### Single Execution Analysis

1. Enter your bearer token
2. Paste an execution URL like:
   ```
   https://pharia-studio.customer.pharia.com/projects/abc123/benchmarks/def456/executions/ghi789
   ```
3. Click "Load Executions"
4. Select an execution from the list to view details

### Execution Comparison

1. Switch to the "Compare Executions" tab
2. Enter your bearer token
3. Paste two different execution URLs
4. Click "Compare Executions"
5. Select a law from the comparison list to see detailed team-by-team differences

## API Integration

The application integrates with Pharia Studio's API endpoints:

- `GET /v1/studio/projects/{project}/evaluation/benchmarks/{benchmark}/executions/{execution}/lineages` - Fetch execution results
- `GET /v1/studio/projects/{project}/evaluation/benchmarks/{benchmark}` - Fetch benchmark metadata
- `GET /v1/studio/projects/{project}/evaluation/benchmarks/{benchmark}/executions/{execution}` - Fetch execution metadata

## Data Models

### LawRelevancyTask Input
```typescript
{
  law_text: string
  law_title: string
  metadata: {
    expression_url: string
    law_id?: string
  }
}
```

### LawRelevancyTask Output
```typescript
{
  team_relevancies: Array<{
    team_id: string
    team_name: string
    is_relevant: boolean
    relevancy_score: number
    reasoning: string
    error?: string
  }>
  subject_matter_summary?: string
}
```

### Evaluation Metrics
```typescript
{
  is_correct: boolean
  accuracy_score: number
  overall_f1_score: number
  precision: number
  recall: number
  team_matches: Array<{
    team_id: string
    expected_relevant: boolean
    actual_relevant: boolean
    matches: boolean
  }>
}
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Type Checking

```bash
npm run type-check
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**: 
   - Verify your bearer token is correct and hasn't expired
   - Check that you have access to the specified project/benchmark

2. **URL Parsing Errors**:
   - Ensure you're copying the complete execution URL
   - URL must include `/executions/{id}` at the end

3. **No Data Found**:
   - Verify the execution exists and has completed
   - Check that the benchmark contains LawRelevancyTask executions

4. **CORS Issues**:
   - In development, the app uses a proxy to handle CORS
   - For production deployment, ensure proper CORS configuration

### Performance Considerations

- Large executions with many teams may take longer to load
- The application automatically paginates API requests to handle large datasets
- Consider filtering or limiting the number of executions displayed for better performance
