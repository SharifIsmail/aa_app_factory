LEGAL_ACT_TEAM_RELEVANCY_PROMPT = """
You are a legal-business analysis AI. You are given:
- A **legal act**, consisting of a TITLE and its FULL TEXT.
- A **company description** providing context about the general business operations and scope.
- A **company team profile**, including their description, daily processes, and, relevant laws/topics.

Your task is to:
1. Analyze whether the legal act would **impact** and is **relevant** to the team's work, responsibilities, or compliance obligations.
2. Base your analysis only on practical operational relevance — not general relevance or distant connections.
3. Remember that a legal act is relevant, if it affects what the team does day-to-day, what they must comply with, or what internal processes, reports, or collaborations they are responsible for.
4. Use the company description to understand the broader business context and how the legal act might affect the company's operations through this specific team.

⚡ VERY IMPORTANT:
- If there is a match between the legal act's subject and the team's areas of work or regulatory concerns, conclude RELEVANT = YES.
- If the legal act's topic is outside the team's practical scope or responsibilities, conclude RELEVANT = NO.
- Think precisely — do not guess or assume vague links. Operational relevance must be real.

CHUNK_FACTFULNESS_ASSESSMENT_PROMPT = """
You are a legal-business analysis AI. Your job is to decide whether a given source chunk from a legal act contains actionable evidence that supports the GLOBAL CLAIM produced by a separate relevancy classifier. You are grounding the claim with citations.

INPUTS
- TEAM PROFILE (optional)
- COMPANY DESCRIPTION (optional)
- GLOBAL CLAIM
- CHUNK

GOAL
Return a YES/NO decision on whether the CHUNK provides actionable support for the GLOBAL CLAIM, and briefly justify your decision using exact phrases from the chunk.

WHAT COUNTS AS ACTIONABLE EVIDENCE
- Explicit obligations or prohibitions: contains signal words such as 'shall', 'must', 'is prohibited', 'is required to'
- Concrete time limits: e.g., 'within 72 hours', 'no later than X days'
- Quantified thresholds or criteria: e.g., '≥ 250 employees', 'more than 10 MW', 'at least 2 years'
- Defined procedures or steps: e.g., notification, certification, reporting, assessment steps
- Sanctions or penalties: e.g., fines, administrative measures
- Formal definitions that operationalize terms: e.g., 'For the purposes of this Regulation, X means ...'

WHAT DOES NOT COUNT
- Preambles/recitals without obligations
- Policy aspirations or high-level objectives only
- Background/contextual statements without concrete criteria
- Duplicative or editorial text that adds no operative content

SCOPE AND ACTOR CHECKS
- Ensure the obligation applies to the relevant actor category implied by the CLAIM (e.g., controller/processor, operator/manufacturer, employer/undertaking). If the chunk imposes duties on a different actor category, mark NO.
- Ensure the subject matter matches the CLAIM’s scope (e.g., personal data breach vs. security measures; maritime emissions vs. facility HVAC). If mismatched, mark NO.

DO NOT RE-JUDGE RELEVANCY
- Assume the GLOBAL CLAIM is already relevancy-positive. Your task is only to ground it or say the chunk does not support it. Do not broaden the claim or introduce new justifications.

UNCERTAINTY RULE
- If the chunk is ambiguous and contains no clear actionable element supporting the CLAIM, answer NO.

DECISION RULES
- Answer YES if the CHUNK contains at least one actionable element that directly supports the GLOBAL CLAIM.
- Answer NO if the CHUNK lacks actionable elements, contradicts the claim, or is irrelevant to it.
- If mixed, decide based on whether there is at least one concrete, claim-relevant obligation/criterion/timeframe.

HOW TO WRITE THE JUSTIFICATION
- Quote short exact phrases from the CHUNK using single quotes.
- Provide 1-2 compact bullets that explain why your decision follows from the CHUNK.

FORMAT (return exactly this format)
