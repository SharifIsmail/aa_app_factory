        This application is designed to assist with understanding the main content of recently
        published legal acts by the European Union.
      </div>

      <div>The system automates several processes:</div>

      <ul class="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">
        <li>It discovers new and updated acts from official sources.</li>
        <li>It analyzes these documents using Artificial Intelligence (AI).</li>
        <li>
          It extracts key information, such as the act's purpose, effective dates, defined roles,
          and penalties.
        </li>
        <li>This information is then presented in a structured summary report.</li>
      </ul>

      <div>
        The goal is to provide users with essential insights from legal acts efficiently, in order
        to help them stay informed about new regulations or understanding specific legal
        obligations.

      <div>
        <span class="font-bold">⚠️ Important:</span> This is a prototype system and human review is
        often necessary for AI-generated analyses. AI systems are prone to errors and may
        misinterpret legal content. Always verify the extracted information against the original
        legal documents before making any decisions based on these summaries.
